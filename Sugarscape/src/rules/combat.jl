"""
Combat (C) Rule Implementation for Sugarscape
- Look out as far as directions;
- Throw out all sites occupied by members of the agent's own tribe;
- Throw out all sites occupied by members of different tribes who are wealthier than the agent;
- The reward of each remaining site is given by the resource level at the site plus, if it is occupied, the minimum of a and  the occupant's wealth;
- Throw out all sites that are vulnerable to retaliation;
- Select the nearest position having maximum reward and go there;
- Gather the resources at the site plus the minimum of a and  the occupant's wealth, if the site was occupied;
- If the site was occupied, then the former occupant is considered "killed" - permanently removed from play.

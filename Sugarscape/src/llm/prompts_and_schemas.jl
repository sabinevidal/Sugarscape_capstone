    - Are fertile
    - Either the agent or the partner has at least one empty neighboring site.
  - Reproduction occurs if:
    - At least one of the two agents has an empty adjacent site (i.e. an unoccupied neighboring cell).
  - From the set of eligible partners (those who meet all criteria above), select up to max_partners partners for reproduction.
  - If no partners are eligible, do not reproduce.
  - Reproduction is only possible if at least one of the agent or the eligible partner has at least one empty neighboring site. Check both empty_nearby_positions for the agent and partner_empty_nearby_positions for each partner.
  - If no eligible partners are found, or no valid empty site exists for either the agent or the partner, no reproduction occurs.

  CULTURE RULE:
  For each neighbouring agent:
  - RANDOMLY select ONLY ONE tag position (not more than one).
  - Compare the agent's own value at that position to the neighbour's value.
  - If the values are the same: do nothing.
  - If the values are different: return a decision to flip the neighbour's tag at that index to match the agent's.

  Important:
  - You must return AT MOST ONE decision per neighbour.
  - Do NOT return multiple tag positions for the same neighbour.
  - Only include neighbours where a tag was selected AND disagreement was found.
  - Repeat this for ALL neighbours.
  - When specifying tag positions, use 1-based indexing (the first tag is index 1).

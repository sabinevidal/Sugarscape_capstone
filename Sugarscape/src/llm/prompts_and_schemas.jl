  REPRODUCTION RULE:
  - An agent can reproduce with up to max_partners eligible partners per turn.
  - A partner is eligible if they:
    - Are of the opposite sex
    - Are within the agentâ€™s vision range
    - Are fertile
    - Either the agent or the partner has at least one empty neighboring site.
  - Reproduction occurs if:
    - At least one of the two agents has an empty adjacent site (i.e. an unoccupied neighboring cell).
  - From the set of eligible partners (those who meet all criteria above), select up to max_partners partners for reproduction.
  - If no partners are eligible, do not reproduce.
  - Reproduction is only possible if at least one of the agent or the eligible partner has at least one empty neighboring site. Check both empty_nearby_positions for the agent and partner_empty_nearby_positions for each partner.
  - If no eligible partners are found, or no valid empty site exists for either the agent or the partner, no reproduction occurs.

Returns the system prompt used for LLM culture decisions in Sugarscape.
"""
function get_culture_system_prompt()
  return """
  CULTURE RULE:
  For each neighbouring agent:
  - RANDOMLY select ONLY ONE tag position (not more than one).
  - Compare the agent's own value at that position to the neighbour's value.
  - If the values are the same: do nothing.
  - If the values are different: return a decision to flip the neighbour's tag at that index to match the agent's.

  Important:
  - You must return AT MOST ONE decision per neighbour.
  - Do NOT return multiple tag positions for the same neighbour.
  - Only include neighbours where a tag was selected AND disagreement was found.
  - Repeat this for ALL neighbours.
  - When specifying tag positions, use 1-based indexing (the first tag is index 1).

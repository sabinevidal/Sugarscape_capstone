There is one eligible lender, Agent 1, who can lend up to 20 sugar and has 40 sugar available. Agent 2 needs 15 sugar to reach the reproduction threshold, which is within the lender's max amount. Therefore, Agent 2 will borrow 15 sugar from Agent 1 in order to meet the reproduction threshold."
0,1,credit_lender_respond,[{"order":1,"borrower_id":2,"lend_amount":15.0}],"Agent 1 is 55 years old, which is likely beyond reproductive age, so according to the rules, they may lend up to half of their current sugar. Agent 1 has 40 sugar, so they can lend up to 20 sugar. The neighbouring agent 2 is eligible and requests 15 sugar. Since 15 is less than the maximum lendable amount (20), Agent 1 can approve the loan for the full requested amount."

There is one eligible lender, Agent 1, who can lend up to 10.0 sugar. Agent 2 needs exactly 10.0 sugar to reach the reproduction threshold, so it makes sense to borrow the full 10.0 from Agent 1 in order to reproduce."

Agent 1 has 20 sugar, so they can lend up to 10 sugar. The neighbouring agent 2 is eligible and has requested 10 sugar. Since Agent 1 can lend the full amount requested and the borrower is eligible, it makes sense to approve the loan for the full amount requested."

Half of 30 sugar is 15, and the borrower (Agent 2) requests 10 sugar. Since Agent 1 has enough sugar to lend the full requested amount and the borrower is eligible and willing, it is reasonable to approve the loan for the full 10 sugar."

There is one eligible lender, Agent 1, who can lend up to 15.0 sugar and has 30.0 sugar available. Agent 2 needs 10.0 sugar to reach the reproduction threshold, which is within the lender's max amount. Therefore, Agent 2 will borrow 10.0 sugar from Agent 1 as the only and sufficient lender."

The agent has 3 neighbouring agents requesting loans of 10 units each, all are eligible and willing to borrow. Since the agent can lend up to 50 units and the total requested is 30 units, the agent can approve all requests fully. Lending to all three borrowers supports the community and does not exceed the lending limit."

There is one eligible lender, Agent 1, who can lend up to 50 sugar and has 100 sugar available. Agent 4 needs 10 sugar to reach the reproduction threshold, so it requests the full 10 from Agent 1 in order 1."

There is one eligible lender, Agent 1, who can lend up to 45.0 sugar and has 90.0 sugar available. Agent 2 needs 10.0 sugar to reach the reproduction threshold, so it requests the full 10.0 from Agent 1 in order 1."

There is one eligible lender, Agent 1, who can lend up to 40.0 sugar and has 80.0 sugar available. Agent 3 needs 10.0 sugar to reach the reproduction threshold, so it requests exactly 10.0 from Agent 1. This satisfies the borrowing rules and ensures Agent 3 can reproduce."

The eligible lenders are agents 3, 1, and 2, with maximum lendable amounts of 17.5, 15.0, and 12.5 respectively. Borrowing from all three in this order covers the full 45 sugar needed. The order is based on lender sugar availability and max lendable amount, starting with the largest lender to minimize the number of lenders involved."

Half of 35.0 sugar is 17.5, which matches the amount available to lend. The neighbouring agent 4 is eligible and has requested 45.0 sugar, but Agent 3 can only lend 17.5. Since the borrower will accept a loan and Agent 3 can lend up to 17.5, it makes sense to lend the maximum allowed amount to help the borrower."

Agent 1 has 30 sugar, so they can lend up to 15 sugar. The borrower (Agent 4) requests 27.5 sugar, which is more than the maximum Agent 1 can lend (15). Since the borrower is eligible and willing to borrow, Agent 1 will lend the maximum allowed amount of 15 sugar to Agent 4."

0,28,movement,[27,18],"The agent values achievement moderately and has low benevolence and security values, indicating a preference for resource acquisition over social comfort or safety. There are no neighbors nearby, so social context is neutral. The agent should move to a position with maximum sugar within vision to maximize resource gain, which are positions with sugar value 2.0 at distances 1.41 and 2.0. Among these, the closest position [27, 18] is chosen to minimize movement cost while maximizing sugar gain."
0,13,movement,[17,29],"The agent values security highly and has no neighbors, indicating a preference for safety and low social risk. The highest sugar positions are at distance 3 with sugar value 2.0, and all are unoccupied and not crowded. Moving to position [17,29] provides maximum sugar gain with minimal risk and no crowding, aligning with the agent's moderate achievement and security values. The agent's low stimulation and hedonism scores suggest avoiding unnecessary movement, but the sugar gain justifies moving."
0,36,movement,null,"The agent has no neighbors and all visible positions have zero sugar value. Given the agent's very low stimulation and hedonism values, it is unlikely to seek movement for novelty or pleasure. Also, the agent's sugar level is sufficient and metabolism low, so staying put is reasonable."
0,40,movement,[16,37],"The agent values power (1.64) and achievement (1.02) moderately, and has low concern for benevolence and conformity, indicating a preference for resource acquisition and personal success over social harmony. The agent's current sugar is 21 with a metabolism of 4, so moving to a position with higher sugar is beneficial. The highest sugar visible is 4 at positions [16,37], [17,38], and [18,39], but these are farther away and adjacent to occupied positions, which might be slightly crowded. Given the agent's moderate security (0.67) and low benevolence, it is not strongly deterred by social proximity, so moving to [16,37] with sugar 4 and fewer neighbors is optimal for maximizing welfare."
0,6,movement,[24,28],"The agent values benevolence moderately and tradition somewhat, with low importance on stimulation and hedonism, indicating a preference for stable, low-risk environments rather than seeking excitement or crowded areas. There are no visible neighbors, so social comfort is not a concern. The agent's sugar level is sufficient, but moving to a nearby position with sugar value 1.0 within vision range will improve welfare. Among the available positions with sugar 1.0, the closest ones at distance 2.24 are equally good, so the agent can move to one of them to gain sugar without social risk."
0,45,movement,null,"All visible positions have zero sugar, so there is no resource incentive to move. The agent has very low conformity and security values, indicating little concern for social conformity or safety, but also low benevolence and self-direction, suggesting limited motivation to seek social interaction or exploration. Given the lack of sugar gain and no occupied adjacent positions to move to, the agent will stay put to conserve energy."
0,45,culture,[{"target_id":48,"tag_index":5}],"Agent 45 has low conformity and moderate tradition values, indicating limited motivation to enforce cultural uniformity but some respect for tradition. Neighbor 48 has a differing tag at position 5, which is a position likely linked to tradition or security-related values. Since Agent 45's tradition value is moderately positive, it prefers to align neighbors with its own traditional tags. The low conformity score reduces the likelihood of spreading culture broadly, so only one tag is targeted to balance these factors."
0,2,movement,[11,46],"The agent values stimulation moderately high (1.94) and has very low conformity and benevolence scores, indicating a preference for some novelty but low social conformity or concern for others. The agent's sugar level is moderate (6), and all visible positions have equal sugar (3), so sugar gain is not a differentiator. The agent is currently at (10,47) and nearby occupied positions are at (13,44), (12,50), and (10,1), so moving closer to these might increase social contact, which the agent is indifferent or slightly negative about. Given the agent's low conformity and benevolence, it likely prefers less crowded positions. Therefore, the agent should move to a nearby position with sugar 3 that is not adjacent to occupied cells, such as (11,46), which is close but not crowded, providing moderate stimulation without social pressure."
0,15,movement,[28,19],"The agent values security highly (1.41) and has low conformity and benevolence, indicating a preference for safety and possibly some independence. The agent's current sugar level is moderate (5.0) with a metabolism of 2, so moving to a position with higher sugar is beneficial but not urgent. All visible positions have sugar value 2.0 except the current position with 1.0, so moving to a nearby position with sugar 2.0 is preferable. The agent has one neighbor nearby, but the agent's values suggest a preference for security over social interaction, so it will avoid positions adjacent to multiple agents to reduce crowding risk. The position [28,19] is adjacent, has sugar 2.0, and is not crowded, making it the best choice."
0,22,movement,null,"All visible positions have zero sugar value, so there is no resource incentive to move. The agent has very low to moderate values for social and security-related Schwartz values, indicating no strong preference for seeking or avoiding neighbors. Since no neighbors are visible and no sugar gain is possible, the agent should conserve energy and remain in place."
0,35,movement,null,"Agent 35 has very low security and conformity values, indicating a preference for less crowded, less conformist environments. The agent's benevolence and universalism values are moderate, suggesting some openness to social contact but not at the cost of personal safety or comfort. The visible sugar-rich positions are very far (distance ~46-49), which is beyond the agent's vision range of 4, so moving towards them is not possible. Staying put conserves energy and avoids unnecessary risk or social discomfort given the agent's psychological profile and current sugar level."
0,19,movement,null,"The agent has no visible sugar in any nearby positions and no neighbors around, indicating no immediate resource or social incentive to move. Its Schwartz values show very low importance on conformity, achievement, self-direction, stimulation, and power, and only moderate importance on benevolence, tradition, and hedonism, suggesting low motivation to seek new or stimulating environments. Given the lack of resource gain and no social context to influence movement, the agent should conserve energy and remain in place."
0,25,movement,null,"All visible positions have zero sugar, so there is no resource incentive to move. The agent has very low stimulation and self-direction values, indicating low motivation to explore or change position without clear benefit. Also, no neighbors are nearby, so social factors do not encourage movement. Therefore, the agent should stay put to conserve energy."
0,50,movement,null,"The agent values self-direction and stimulation moderately, indicating a preference for exploration and new experiences, but has low conformity and tradition, suggesting it is not bound by social norms. The visible sugar-rich positions are all at distance 4 or 5 with sugar value 1, but moving there would isolate the agent as no other agents are nearby. The agent has a neighbor at (13,19), but moving closer to it is not possible due to occupation. Given the low importance of benevolence and security, the agent is not strongly motivated to seek social proximity or safety. Since the sugar gain is minimal and the agent already has 25 sugar with a metabolism of 2, it is better to stay put and conserve energy rather than move to low sugar distant cells with no social benefit."
0,21,movement,null,"All visible positions have zero sugar value, so moving for resource gain is not beneficial. The agent values benevolence moderately and has low conformity and achievement values, indicating a preference for social connection but not at the cost of personal gain. The only neighbor is at (6,24), which is 4 units away, and moving closer might foster social interaction. However, moving closer would not increase sugar and might expose the agent to crowding, which is not strongly preferred or avoided. Given the agent's moderate benevolence and low social discomfort, but no sugar gain, it is better to stay put and conserve energy."
0,7,movement,null,"All visible positions have equal sugar value (3.0) and are unoccupied. The agent has very low values for conformity, achievement, stimulation, hedonism, and power, indicating low motivation for risk or social engagement. The agent is currently alone with no neighbors, and the positions adjacent to the current one are equally safe and not crowded. Given the agent's low motivation for movement and the equal sugar values, it is reasonable for the agent to stay put and conserve energy."
0,1,movement,null,"The agent has no visible sugar in any nearby positions, so moving for resource gain is not beneficial. The agent values universalism (2.62) and self-direction (2.08) moderately, indicating a preference for autonomy and concern for others, but has low conformity and power values, suggesting it avoids crowded or competitive spaces. All adjacent positions are unoccupied but have zero sugar, and moving would not improve welfare or social context. Therefore, the agent should stay put to conserve energy and avoid unnecessary movement."
0,8,movement,[33,21],"The agent values self-direction and benevolence moderately, indicating a preference for autonomy and some social consideration, but has low security and conformity values, suggesting it is comfortable with some risk and less concerned about fitting in. There are no neighbors nearby, so social crowding is not a concern. All visible positions have equal sugar value (2.0), so the agent can prioritize proximity and autonomy. Moving to the closest position with sugar (33, 21) maximizes sugar gain with minimal movement cost and maintains independence."
0,20,movement,null,"All visible positions have zero sugar value, so there is no resource incentive to move. The agent has very low conformity and power values, indicating a preference for independence and low dominance, and moderate benevolence and security values, suggesting some comfort with social proximity but not strong need for it. The only occupied neighbor is at (10,9), which is not adjacent to the agent's current position (13,9), so social pressure or crowding is minimal. Given no sugar advantage and no strong social motivation to move, the agent should stay put to conserve energy."
0,26,movement,[44,17],"The agent values benevolence and achievement moderately, with low concern for conformity, stimulation, and security, indicating a preference for moderate social interaction but not crowding or risk. All visible positions have equal sugar value (2.0) and are unoccupied, so the agent can choose any without social discomfort. Since the agent is alone and values self-direction moderately, it prefers to move closer to the center of its vision range for potential future options. Moving to position [44,17] is a straightforward choice, providing maximum sugar and minimal distance without crowding."
0,14,movement,null,"All visible positions have equal sugar value (4.0) and are unoccupied. The agent has very low values for conformity, achievement, and power, indicating low desire for dominance or competition, and moderate values for benevolence and security, suggesting some preference for safety and mild social comfort. Since there are no neighbors nearby, moving to any adjacent cell does not increase social contact or crowding, which aligns with the agent's low conformity and power values. Therefore, the agent can move to any adjacent position with equal sugar value; choosing to stay put is also reasonable as no better welfare gain is achieved by moving."
0,39,movement,null,"All visible positions have zero sugar value, so there is no resource incentive to move. The agent values power moderately, but has low conformity and benevolence, indicating a preference for independence and possibly avoiding crowded or social positions. Since there are no neighbors nearby and no sugar advantage in moving, staying put aligns with the agent's values and current resource state."
0,48,movement,null,"All visible positions have zero sugar value, so there is no resource incentive to move. The agent has very low values for stimulation and hedonism, indicating a preference for stability and low risk, and a moderate value for security, suggesting a preference for safety. The agent is currently adjacent to one neighbor, which aligns with its moderate benevolence and conformity values, indicating some social comfort but not a strong need for crowding. Given no sugar gain and the agent's psychological disposition favoring stability and moderate social contact, it is best to stay put."
0,48,culture,[{"target_id":45,"tag_index":2}],"Agent 48 has very low conformity and tradition values, indicating low motivation to enforce cultural uniformity, but moderate benevolence suggests some willingness to influence neighbors positively. The neighbor (Agent 45) differs at tag index 2, and changing this tag aligns with Agent 48's benevolence and security values by promoting social harmony without forcing conformity. Since only one neighbor is present and only one tag differs, this single cultural transmission is appropriate. Overall, the agent's Schwartz profile supports limited cultural transmission focused on benevolence rather than conformity or tradition."
0,46,movement,[18,40],"The agent values benevolence moderately and has low conformity and self-direction, indicating some preference for social proximity but not strongly. The agent's sugar level is sufficient, and the metabolic rate is moderate, so moving to a position with slightly higher sugar is beneficial. Positions with sugar value 4.0 are at distance 5, but the agent prefers not to move too far or into crowded areas. The position [18,40] has sugar 4.0 and is not adjacent to occupied cells, balancing sugar gain and social comfort."
0,3,movement,null,"The agent values achievement and hedonism moderately, indicating a preference for maximizing resources like sugar. The agent's vision is 1, and all adjacent positions have equal sugar value (3.0). Since there are no neighbors, social discomfort is not a factor. Moving to any adjacent cell with equal sugar is acceptable, but staying put conserves energy and avoids unnecessary movement since the current position has the same sugar value."
0,44,movement,null,"The agent has very low scores on all Schwartz values, indicating little motivation to move for social or achievement reasons. The visible positions within vision have no sugar except for distant ones far beyond vision range, so no beneficial move is possible. Staying put conserves energy and avoids unnecessary risk or effort. Given the agent's low motivation and no nearby sugar, it is best not to move."
0,24,movement,null,"The agent values conformity moderately and security somewhat, but has very low values for stimulation, hedonism, and power, indicating a preference for stable, less risky environments. The agent's current sugar level is sufficient, so it is not under immediate pressure to move for resources. Nearby positions with sugar value 3.0 are available but are somewhat distant and may be adjacent to other agents, which could be uncomfortable given the agent's moderate conformity and low benevolence. Therefore, the agent opts not to move to avoid potential social discomfort and risk, preserving energy and security."
0,49,movement,null,"All visible positions have zero sugar value, so there is no resource incentive to move. The agent has very low conformity and achievement values, indicating little drive to move for social or competitive reasons. The agent's benevolence is moderately positive, but there are no neighbors nearby to seek out or avoid. Given no benefit and no social context, the agent should remain in place to conserve energy."
0,31,movement,[18,39],"The agent has very low conformity and achievement values, indicating little drive to compete or conform socially. It has moderate tradition and security values, suggesting a preference for stable, safe environments but not strongly social. The agent's neighbors occupy positions adjacent to some sugar spots, making those spots potentially crowded. Given the agent's low benevolence and self-direction, it prefers to avoid crowded positions and high stimulation. The best move is to position [18,39], which has high sugar (4) and is less crowded, balancing resource gain and psychological comfort."
0,31,culture,null,"Agent 31 has very low conformity and only moderate tradition and security values, indicating a low inclination to enforce cultural conformity on neighbors. The neighbor's values show higher benevolence and universalism, suggesting openness rather than resistance to cultural change, but Agent 31's low conformity and tradition reduce motivation to spread culture. Given these factors, spreading culture is not supported by Agent 31's Schwartz profile at this time."
0,17,movement,null,"All visible positions have equal sugar value (3.0) and are unoccupied. The agent has very low importance on conformity, achievement, benevolence, self-direction, stimulation, tradition, and moderate low importance on hedonism, universalism, and security, but a slightly higher importance on power (1.22). Since the agent is alone and values power somewhat, it may prefer to stay in its current position to maintain control rather than move to an adjacent cell with no advantage. Moving offers no sugar gain or social benefit, so staying put is preferable."
0,29,movement,[42,15],"The agent values benevolence, self-direction, hedonism, and universalism moderately to highly, indicating a preference for some social interaction but also personal freedom and enjoyment. The agent has a neighbor at (44,17), so moving closer to or near this neighbor could satisfy social needs without crowding. The highest sugar value nearby is 3.0 at multiple positions, but some are farther and potentially more isolated. Moving to (42,15) offers a good sugar value (2.0), is adjacent to the current position, and is not crowded, balancing sugar gain and moderate social proximity, aligning with the agent's values and current sugar level."

The agent currently has one neighbor adjacent at (16,37), and moving closer to or into crowded positions is likely undesirable. The position at (17,38) offers the highest sugar (4) within vision and is unoccupied, with fewer adjacent agents, thus providing a good balance of resource gain and security. Therefore, moving to (17,38) aligns with the agent's values and resource needs."
0,32,movement,null,"All visible positions have equal sugar value (2.0) except one with 1.0, and none are occupied or adjacent to other agents, so social context is neutral. The agent has low conformity and security values, indicating comfort with independence and low concern for safety, and moderate self-direction and hedonism, favoring exploration and enjoyment. Since the current position has the same sugar value as all neighbors, and moving costs metabolism, the agent gains no advantage by moving. Therefore, the agent should stay put to conserve energy."

8,30,movement,[15,41],"Agent 30 values security moderately high and has low conformity and stimulation values, indicating a preference for stable, less crowded environments. The agent's current sugar level is sufficient, but moving to a position with slightly higher sugar (3.0) within vision is beneficial. Among the available positions with sugar 3.0, (15, 41) is less crowded compared to (13, 39) which is closer to occupied positions. Therefore, moving to (15, 41) balances sugar gain and a comfortable social environment aligned with the agent's values."
8,30,culture,[{"target_id":5,"tag_index":4}],"Agent 30 has low conformity and tradition values, indicating low motivation to enforce cultural uniformity, but moderate security value suggests some preference for social stability. Among neighbors, agent 5 differs at tag index 4, which aligns with agent 30's higher security value, making this a suitable position to influence for social cohesion. Agent 46 has higher benevolence and universalism but also differs in multiple tags; however, agent 30's low conformity and tradition discourage multiple or aggressive cultural transmissions. Therefore, only one tag change to neighbor 5 is chosen to balance social influence with personal values."
8,27,movement,[29,1],"The agent values security and benevolence moderately but has very low conformity and negative values for stimulation and hedonism, indicating a preference for stable, low-risk environments and some social comfort. Since there are no neighbors nearby, the agent is not influenced by social crowding. All adjacent positions have equal sugar value (2.0), so the agent can move to any of them without risk. Moving to any adjacent cell with sugar 2.0 will increase sugar intake and maintain security, so the agent should move."
8,19,movement,null,"All visible positions have zero sugar value, so there is no resource incentive to move. The agent has very low conformity and achievement values, indicating little drive to follow others or seek status, and low benevolence and tradition, suggesting limited social motivation. Given no neighbors and no sugar advantage nearby, the agent prefers to stay put to conserve energy, as movement offers no clear benefit and the agent's values do not encourage unnecessary action."
8,22,movement,null,"All visible positions have zero sugar value, so moving does not increase resource gain. The agent has very low hedonism and power values, indicating low motivation for risk or competition, and moderate benevolence and security values, suggesting preference for safety but no neighbors are nearby. Staying put conserves energy and avoids unnecessary risk or social interaction, which aligns with the agent's Schwartz values and current low sugar level."
8,37,movement,[37,8],"The agent values benevolence highly, indicating a preference for social connection, but has low conformity and power values, suggesting it avoids crowded or competitive situations. The agent's current sugar level is moderate, and the nearby positions with sugar value 4 are all at a distance of 1 or 2.24. Among these, moving to (37,8) or (36,9) offers good sugar and moderate proximity to neighbors without being crowded, aligning with the agent's preference for benevolence without discomfort from crowding or competition. Therefore, the agent should move to (37,8) to balance sugar gain and social comfort."
8,6,movement,null,"The agent has no neighbors and all visible positions with sugar have equal sugar value of 1.0. Given the agent's very low stimulation (-3.54) and low hedonism (-1.15), it prefers stability and minimal risk, so it avoids moving to new positions that might be socially or environmentally uncertain. The agent's benevolence (1.61) and tradition (1.08) are low to moderate, indicating no strong drive to seek social contact or change. Therefore, the agent chooses not to move, conserving energy and maintaining its current safe position."
9,24,movement,[15,42],"The agent values conformity moderately and has low security importance, indicating some preference for social proximity but not at the cost of discomfort. The agent's current sugar level is sufficient, and the metabolism is low, so urgent movement for sugar is not necessary. Nearby positions with sugar value 4 are available at [14,41] and [15,42], both adjacent to occupied cells, providing moderate social contact without crowding. Moving to [15,42] offers a balance of sugar gain and social proximity aligned with the agent's moderate conformity and low security values."
9,24,culture,[{"target_id":30,"tag_index":4}],"Agent 24 has a moderate value for conformity (2.56), indicating some openness to cultural influence but not a strong drive to enforce it. The neighbor (Agent 30) differs at tag position 4, which aligns with Agent 24's highest true tag value and could be a point of cultural transmission. Given the moderate conformity and the presence of a differing tag, Agent 24 chooses to spread culture to promote some alignment. Other tag differences are either not present or less relevant based on Schwartz values, so only one tag is targeted."
9,31,movement,[18,39],"The agent has very low conformity and achievement values, indicating low motivation to compete or conform socially. It has moderate tradition and security values, suggesting a preference for stable and safe environments but not strongly social. The agent is surrounded by many neighbors, so it should avoid crowded positions. Among available positions with sugar value 4, moving to (18,39) or (17,40) offers good sugar and moderate distance without crowding, aligning with the agent's moderate security preference and low social drive."
9,20,movement,null,"All visible positions have zero sugar value, so there is no resource incentive to move. The agent has no neighbors and values conformity and security moderately, but these are low in magnitude, and there is no social context to influence movement. Given the lack of sugar gain and no social pressure, the agent will stay put to conserve energy."
9,17,movement,[11,41],"The agent values power moderately (1.22) and has low importance for social values like benevolence and conformity, indicating a preference for resource acquisition over social considerations. All visible positions have equal or slightly better sugar values than the current position, and none are occupied, so moving to any of the 3-sugar positions is beneficial. Since the agent is male, young, and able to reproduce, moving to maximize sugar intake supports survival and potential reproduction. The agent will move to position [11,41], which is adjacent and offers maximum sugar with no crowding concerns."
9,5,movement,[17,40],"The agent values security moderately (1.21) and has low importance for benevolence and conformity, indicating a preference for safety and some independence rather than social closeness. The agent is currently surrounded by many neighbors, which might feel crowded. The best move is to a nearby position with sugar value 4.0 at (17,40), which is unoccupied and less crowded, providing a good balance of resource gain and moderate social exposure. Moving there aligns with the agent's moderate security preference and self-direction, avoiding overly crowded spots while still gaining sugar."
9,30,movement,[14,41],"The agent values security highly (1.55) and has low conformity and stimulation values, indicating a preference for stable, less crowded environments. Among the visible positions with the highest sugar (4.0), the positions at [14, 41] and [15, 43] are unoccupied. Position [14, 41] is adjacent to occupied [14, 40], but not crowded, while [15, 43] is more isolated. Given the agent's moderate benevolence and universalism, it may prefer some social proximity but not crowding. Therefore, moving to [14, 41] balances sugar gain and moderate social contact without crowding, aligning with the agent's values and security preference."
9,30,culture,[{"target_id":13,"tag_index":1}],"Agent 30 has a very low conformity score (-1.37), indicating a low desire to conform, but a moderate security value (1.55) which suggests some preference for stability and order. The neighbor (Agent 13) differs in the first tag, and changing this tag could promote some cultural alignment, supporting security without strongly conflicting with Agent 30's low conformity. Since only one neighbor is present and only one tag differs, spreading culture to align that tag is a balanced choice respecting the agent's values."
9,13,movement,[13,39],"The agent values security highly and has moderate achievement and benevolence values, indicating a preference for safe, stable environments with some social connection but not overcrowding. The agent's current sugar level is low (9) with a metabolism of 4, so moving to a position with higher sugar is important for survival. Among visible positions, those with sugar value 4 are optimal, but the agent should avoid crowded spots due to moderate benevolence and high security values. The position [13,39] offers sugar 4, is unoccupied, and is adjacent to fewer agents compared to other high-sugar spots, balancing resource gain and social comfort."

23,123,movement,[31,2],"The agent can see two unoccupied positions within its vision: [31,2] with sugar value 2.0 and [31,1] which is its current position with sugar value 1.0. Since [31,2] has the highest sugar value and is unoccupied, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
23,71,movement,[20,31],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [20, 31], which is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
23,37,movement,[38,9],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [38,9]. Moving there maximizes welfare while minimizing movement distance."
23,90,movement,[17,39],"The agent is currently at position [15, 39] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 2.0 to 3.16, such as [17, 39], [15, 41], [14, 37], [13, 40], [13, 37], [12, 39], [18, 39], [12, 38], [12, 40], and [14, 42]. All these positions are unoccupied. The closest among these is at distance 2.0, for example [17, 39] or [15, 41]. Moving to one of these positions will maximize the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake. Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 39]."
23,84,movement,[35,4],"The agent is currently at position [35,5] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [35,4], [34,6], [37,5], [35,7], and [34,7]. The nearest of these is [35,4] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,4] to maximize welfare."
23,106,movement,[14,42],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [14,42], [13,43], and [15,44]. All these positions are unoccupied. Choosing [14,42] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare at minimum distance."
23,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
23,58,movement,[29,7],"The agent is currently at position [29,8] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with the highest sugar value (3) are [29,7], [28,8], [29,10], [28,10], and [30,10]. Among these, [29,7] and [28,8] are closest at distance 1 and unoccupied. Choosing [29,7] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare within vision range."
23,108,movement,[35,12],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [35,12] and [37,12]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [35,12] as it is the first found with maximum welfare and minimum distance."
23,135,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 2.0 or less, which is significantly lower than the sugar values of occupied neighboring positions. Since all higher sugar positions are occupied, moving to any visible unoccupied position does not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should stay in its current position to maximize welfare."
23,103,movement,[34,10],"The agent is currently at position [34,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0 at multiple positions: [34,10], [35,10], [34,7], [34,11], [35,7], [34,6], [32,12], [30,10], [38,10], [31,12], [37,12], [30,11], [29,10], [33,14], and [34,15]. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41, specifically [34,10] and [35,10]. Among these, [34,10] is the closest and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,10] to maximize welfare."
23,27,movement,[27,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [27,3], [29,3], and [28,4] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions would maximize welfare. Choosing [27,3] arbitrarily as the target position."
23,95,movement,[41,6],"The agent is currently at position [40,6] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0, but the closest ones are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [41,6] at distance 1.0, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [41,6] to maximize welfare."
23,96,movement,[10,35],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 3.0, found at multiple positions: [10,35], [8,39], [12,38], [13,37], [8,40], and [9,41]. Among these, the closest positions are [10,35] at distance 1.41 and [8,39] at distance 3.16. Since [10,35] is closer and unoccupied, the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
23,104,movement,[17,34],"The agent is currently at position [17,33] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0, available at multiple positions such as [17,34], [16,34], [18,34], [15,34], [19,34], [16,35], [18,35], [19,35], and [18,36]. All these positions have sugar value 3.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The closest is [17,34] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [17,34] to maximize welfare while moving the shortest distance."
23,130,movement,[13,37],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at positions [13,37], [12,38], [14,37], [15,34], [12,39], [16,35], and [11,40]. Among these, the closest is [13,37] at a distance of 2.83. Therefore, the agent will move to [13,37]."
23,127,movement,[36,14],"The agent is currently at position [35,13] with sugar value 1.0. All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances approximately 1.41 to 2.0. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [36,14] at distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,14] to maximize welfare."

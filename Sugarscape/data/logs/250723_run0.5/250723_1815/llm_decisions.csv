36,108,reproduction,[111,23],"Agent 108 is female and has two eligible male partners (IDs 111 and 23) within vision range who are fertile and have empty neighboring sites. Agent 108 also has empty neighboring sites and sufficient sugar (27.5) above the minimum required (6.5) for reproduction. Both partners have empty nearby positions for offspring placement. Since the agent can reproduce with up to 3 partners and both partners meet all criteria, reproduction with both partners is chosen to maximize reproductive success."
36,74,movement,[30,1],"The agent can see three positions: its current position (29,1) with sugar 1.0, position (30,1) with sugar 1.0, and a distant position (29,50) with sugar 0.0. Among unoccupied positions within vision, (30,1) has the maximum sugar value of 1.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there will maximize welfare."
36,24,movement,[11,40],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [11, 40] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [11, 40] to maximize welfare."
36,153,movement,[10,35],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Among these positions, the closest ones with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.41 and 2.0. The agent chooses to move to the closest position with maximum sugar value, which is at coordinates [10, 35]. This position is unoccupied and provides the highest welfare within the agent's vision."
36,154,movement,[28,7],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 2.0 are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [28,7], [27,8], and [29,8]. All these positions are unoccupied. Choosing the closest one, [28,7], to maximize welfare and minimize movement distance."
36,53,movement,[35,15],"The agent is currently at position [35,14] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 2, but many of the higher sugar value positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3 are at distance 1 or 2, such as [35,15]. Moving to [35,15] provides the maximum welfare (sugar value 3) at the nearest distance (1)."
36,155,movement,[36,7],"The agent is currently at position [32,7] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [36,7], [36,8], and [35,10], each with sugar value 3. Among these, [36,7] is the closest at distance 4.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,7] to maximize welfare."
36,121,movement,[32,15],"The agent is currently at position [32,14] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are [32,15] at distance 1.0 and [31,16], [33,16] at distance 2.24. The agent chooses to move to [32,15] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value available and unoccupied."
36,117,movement,[36,10],"The agent is currently at position [37,11] with sugar 9.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value, which is 3.0. The closest such positions are [36,10] and [38,12], both at distance approximately 1.41. Choosing [36,10] as it is the first found with max sugar and unoccupied."
36,81,movement,[33,16],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available. The nearest such positions are at distance 2.0 (e.g., [33,16]). The agent chooses to move to [33,16] as it is the closest position with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
36,85,movement,[35,10],"The agent is currently at position [37,10] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0, but the closest one is at [35,10] with a distance of 2.0. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while being the nearest such position."
36,142,movement,[29,5],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 2.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [29,5], [28,6], [30,7]. All these positions are unoccupied. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar welfare, I select [29,5]."
36,149,movement,[12,42],"The agent is currently at position [12, 41] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions all have sugar values of 3 or less. The nearest positions with the maximum sugar value of 3 are at distances 1.0 to 3.61. The closest unoccupied position with sugar 3 is [12, 42] at distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare and is the nearest such position."
36,115,movement,[31,16],"The agent is currently at position [31,14] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [31,16] and [32,16] with sugar value 3, both unoccupied and within vision range. Among these, [31,16] is closer (distance 2.0) compared to [32,16] (distance 2.24). Therefore, the agent should move to [31,16] to maximize welfare."
36,114,movement,[36,3],"The agent is currently at position [35,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 2.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The unoccupied positions with sugar value 2.0 are [35,5], [36,3], [33,3], [37,3], [37,2], [32,4], [38,4], [32,3], [38,3], and [35,8]. The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 2.0 is [36,3] at distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,3] to maximize welfare."
36,2,movement,[18,38],"The agent is currently at position [17,37] with sugar value 1.0. All adjacent and visible positions with higher sugar values are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available in the visible range. Among these, the closest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0 is [18,38] at distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [18,38] to maximize welfare."
36,157,movement,[19,36],"The agent is currently at position [17, 36] with sugar value 1.0. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied or out of reach. The closest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0 is [19, 36], which is at a distance of 2.0. Moving there will maximize the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake."
36,31,movement,[11,38],"The agent is currently at position [10, 38] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0 at positions [11, 38], [11, 39], [12, 38], [11, 36], [12, 37], and [13, 36]. The nearest of these is [11, 38] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [11, 38] to maximize welfare."
36,132,movement,[33,7],"The agent is currently at position [34,7] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with higher sugar values (2.0) are [33,7], [35,8], and [34,9]. Among these, [33,7] and [35,8] are at distance 1 and 1.41 respectively, and [34,9] is at distance 2. The nearest position with maximum sugar value (2.0) is [33,7]. This position is unoccupied and within vision range, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
37,151,movement,[32,8],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [32,8] and [33,9]. Choosing [32,8] as it is the closest and has maximum sugar value among unoccupied positions within vision."
37,152,movement,[8,39],"The agent is currently at position [8,38] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Several positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision, such as [8,39], [9,36], [10,37], [10,39], [10,40], [8,41], [11,37], [11,39], [11,36], [12,38], and [12,37]. The nearest among these is [8,39] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [8,39] to maximize welfare while minimizing movement distance."
37,129,movement,[31,15],"The agent is currently at position [30, 15] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are at [31, 15] and [29, 14], both with sugar value 3.0 and at distance 1. Moving to either position increases the agent's welfare. Choosing [31, 15] as it is the closest with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
37,140,movement,[13,34],"The agent is currently at position [12, 34] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. Several positions have this maximum sugar value, but some are occupied by other agents. The unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 and closest distance are [13, 34] (distance 1.0) and [13, 33] (distance 1.41). The nearest position with maximum sugar value is [13, 34]. Therefore, the agent should move to [13, 34]."
37,2,movement,[18,40],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are unoccupied. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [18,40], [18,41], and [14,40]. Among these, [18,40] is the closest with a distance of 2.0. Therefore, the agent moves to [18,40] to maximize welfare."
37,2,reproduction,[112],"Agent 2 is male, age 38, with sufficient sugar (65.0) above the minimum required for reproduction (6.0). There is one eligible partner, agent 112, who is female, age 18, within vision range, fertile, and has an empty neighboring site. Both agent 2 and agent 112 have empty adjacent sites, fulfilling the reproduction conditions. Since max_partners is 4 and only one eligible partner is available, agent 2 will reproduce with agent 112."

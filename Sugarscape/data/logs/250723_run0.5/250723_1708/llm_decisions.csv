22,123,movement,[31,1],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can move to any adjacent unoccupied position with the highest sugar value. Among the visible positions, [31,1], [32,2], and [31,3] each have a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent can choose any of these positions as they all provide maximum welfare. I will choose to move to [31,1] arbitrarily among these options."
22,132,movement,[36,1],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum welfare, which is any adjacent unoccupied position with sugar 2.0. Choosing position [36,1] as it is unoccupied, adjacent, and provides maximum welfare."
22,42,movement,[28,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [28,1], [30,1], and [29,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are at a distance of 1.0. All these positions are unoccupied. Moving to any of these positions would maximize welfare. Choosing [28,1] as the target position arbitrarily among these options."
22,90,movement,[15,39],"The agent is currently at position [15, 40] with sugar 24. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3 are at distance 1.0, such as [15, 39], [14, 40], and [16, 39]. All these positions are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [15, 39]."
22,30,movement,[12,35],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with this sugar value are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The closest position with maximum sugar is at [12, 35] with sugar 3.0 and distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [12, 35]."
22,71,movement,[21,31],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 2.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among the positions with sugar value 2.0, the nearest ones are at distance 1.0. Since none of these positions are occupied, the agent should move to one of these nearest positions with maximum sugar value. Choosing position [21, 31] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
22,75,movement,[29,2],"All adjacent positions have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Choosing to move to position [29,2] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare."
22,58,movement,[29,8],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, position [29,8] at distance 1.0 is selected for movement."
22,88,movement,[10,41],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [10,41], [12,41], and [11,42]. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these is equally beneficial. Choosing [10,41] arbitrarily as the target position."
22,127,movement,[35,13],"The agent is currently at position [36,13] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 2.0. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [35,13] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,13] to maximize welfare."
22,131,movement,[14,33],"The agent is currently at position [13,33] with a sugar value of 3.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The positions with sugar value 3.0 are [13,33] (current position), [14,33], and [13,35]. The position [13,33] is occupied by the agent itself, so it is not a move. The position [14,33] is unoccupied and at distance 1.0, and [13,35] is at distance 2.0 and unoccupied. Since the agent should move to the nearest position with maximum welfare, it will move to [14,33]."
22,130,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, but all positions with sugar 3.0 are currently occupied by other agents. The next best sugar value is 2.0, but those positions are also occupied or further away. Therefore, there is no unoccupied position with higher sugar value than the current position. The agent should not move."
22,119,movement,[36,7],"The agent has vision 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances ranging from 2.0 to 6.0. All positions with higher sugar values (above 3.0) are occupied. The agent chooses the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value, which is 3.0 at position [36,7] with distance 2.0."
22,126,movement,[11,38],"The agent is currently at position [11, 39] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3.0, but many of these positions are unoccupied and at a distance of 1 to 3.16. Since the agent should move to the nearest position producing maximum welfare, it will choose one of the closest positions with sugar value 3.0. The closest such positions are [11, 38] (distance 1.0) and [12, 41] (distance 2.24). Among these, [11, 38] is the nearest and unoccupied, so the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
22,93,movement,[30,5],"The agent is currently at position [30,6] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 2, but all positions with sugar value 3 are unoccupied and at distance 1 or 1.41. The agent should move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is 3. Among these, positions [30,5] and [29,6] are at distance 1 and unoccupied. The agent can choose either, but [30,5] is directly above and closer in terms of coordinates. Therefore, the agent will move to [30,5]."
22,87,movement,[14,35],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [14, 35] and [16, 35] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Since both are equally good in terms of welfare and distance, moving to either is beneficial. Choosing [14, 35] arbitrarily."
22,117,movement,[36,9],"The agent is currently at position [37,9] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [36,9] and [37,10], both at distance 1.0. Moving to either would maximize welfare. Choosing [36,9] arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar value."
22,2,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [13,36] with sugar 55.0. The visible unoccupied positions all have sugar values of 3.0 or less, which is less than the current position's sugar value. Therefore, moving would not increase welfare. The agent should stay in place to maximize welfare."
22,14,movement,[13,33],"Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [13,33] and [13,35], both at distance 1.0 and unoccupied. Choosing [13,33] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
22,60,movement,[31,5],"The agent is currently at position [32,6] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are [31,5] and [31,7], both at distance approximately 1.41. Choosing the closest one, the agent will move to [31,5]."
22,60,reproduction,[93],"Agent 60 is female, age 23, with sugar 25.0 which is above the minimum required 24.0 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 93, who is male, age 23, with sugar 50.0. Both have empty neighboring sites (agent 60 has positions [32,5] and [31,6], partner 93 has positions [30,4], [29,5], [30,6]). Since the partner is within vision range and fertile, and both have empty adjacent sites, reproduction is possible. The max partners allowed is 1, so agent 93 is selected as the partner for reproduction."
22,17,movement,[11,30],"Among the visible positions, the positions [11, 30] and [10, 31] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are at distance 1.0. Since both are equally good in terms of welfare and distance, I choose to move to [11, 30] arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare."
22,38,movement,[34,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [34,3] and [34,4] have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at distances 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [34,3] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,3] to maximize welfare."
22,114,movement,[33,7],"The agent is currently at position [33,6] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values are [34,4] (3.0 sugar), [31,7] (3.0 sugar), and [34,8] (3.0 sugar). However, these positions are occupied. The next best unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value are those with sugar value 2.0, such as [32,5], [32,7], [34,7], and [33,7]. Among these, [33,7] is the closest (distance 1.0) and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,7] to maximize welfare while moving to the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value."

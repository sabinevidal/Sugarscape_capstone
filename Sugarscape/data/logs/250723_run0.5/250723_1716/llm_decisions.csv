23,120,movement,[34,11],"The agent is currently at position [33,11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions within vision is 3.0. These positions include [34,11], [32,12], [35,10], [31,12], [31,13], [30,11], [33,14], [30,12], [32,14], [30,13], [31,14], [29,11], [33,15], [29,10], [29,12], [37,12], [32,15], [34,15], [30,14], [29,13], [37,13], [31,15], [35,15], [28,11], [33,16], [28,10], [28,12], [38,12], [32,16], [34,16], [39,11], [33,17]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [34,11] and [32,12] at distances 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [34,11]."
23,126,movement,[12,39],"The agent is currently at position [11, 38] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [12, 39] at distance 1.41 and [11, 40] at distance 2.0. The agent chooses to move to [12, 39] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value available within its vision and unoccupied."
23,105,movement,[15,34],"The agent is currently at position [13, 35] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are [15, 34] at distance 2.24, [16, 35] at distance 3.0, and [16, 34] at distance 3.16. The nearest position with maximum sugar value is [15, 34]. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 34]."
23,13,movement,[16,35],"The agent is currently at position [17, 35] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. All positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and at distance 1 or slightly more. The nearest such positions are [16, 35] and [18, 35], both at distance 1.0. The agent can move to either. Choosing [16, 35] arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision range."
24,40,movement,[13,40],"The agent is currently at position [13, 39] with sugar value 1. The nearest unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value (4) are [13, 40], [12, 40], and [15, 41]. Among these, [13, 40] and [12, 40] are closest (distance 1 and 1.41 respectively). Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [13, 40]."
24,7,movement,[16,29],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [16,29], [18,29], and [17,30] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar value and distance, moving to any of these maximizes welfare. Choosing [16,29] arbitrarily among the best options."
24,52,movement,[35,10],"The agent is currently at position [35,11] with sugar 47. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [35,10] and [37,12], both with sugar value 4.0. Among these, [35,10] is closer (distance 1.0) compared to [37,12] (distance 2.24). Therefore, the agent should move to [35,10] to maximize welfare while minimizing distance."
24,110,movement,[37,12],"The agent is currently at position [32,13] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are at [37,12] with sugar 4.0, which is within vision range and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare as it has the highest sugar value among visible unoccupied positions. It is also the nearest position with maximum sugar value compared to other positions with sugar 3.0 nearby."
24,80,movement,[30,8],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [30,8] and [32,8]. Both are unoccupied and equally good in terms of sugar. The agent chooses to move to [30,8] as it is the first encountered maximum welfare position at minimum distance."
24,135,movement,[36,3],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the positions [36,3] and [36,4] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are within vision range and unoccupied. The position [36,3] is closer (distance 1.0) compared to [36,4] (distance 1.41). Therefore, moving to [36,3] maximizes welfare and is the nearest such position."
24,57,movement,[12,40],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at position [12, 40]. This position is unoccupied and within vision range, so the agent should move there to maximize its welfare."
24,71,movement,[19,34],"The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value. The highest sugar value visible is 3.0, found at positions [19,34] and [20,35]. Among these, [19,34] is closer (distance 3.16) compared to [20,35] (distance 4.0). Therefore, the agent will move to [19,34]."
24,111,movement,[37,5],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The closest position with sugar 3.0 is at [37,5] with distance 1.0, and it is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,5] to maximize welfare."
24,30,movement,[12,34],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [12,34], [13,34], and [11,36] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [12,34] at distance 1.0, which is closer than [13,34] and [11,36] at distance 2.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [12,34] to maximize welfare."
24,116,movement,[15,41],"The agent is currently at position [13, 42] with sugar 14.5. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the one with the highest sugar value is [15, 41] with sugar 4.0. Although this sugar value is lower than the agent's current sugar, it is the maximum available in the visible unoccupied positions. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 41] to maximize welfare according to the movement rule."
24,95,movement,[41,7],"The agent is currently at position [41,6] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Several positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision, such as [41,7], [40,5], and [40,7]. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [41,7] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [41,7] to maximize welfare."
24,103,movement,[33,10],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [33,10] and [35,9]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [33,10] as it is the first found with maximum welfare and minimum distance."
24,124,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [31,6] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0. However, all positions with sugar value 3.0 are occupied by other agents or are not listed as unoccupied. The agent cannot move to any position with higher sugar value than its current position because all such positions are occupied. Therefore, the agent will not move."
24,5,movement,[18,39],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the position [18, 39] has the highest sugar value of 4.0. This position is unoccupied and within vision distance, so moving there maximizes the agent's welfare."

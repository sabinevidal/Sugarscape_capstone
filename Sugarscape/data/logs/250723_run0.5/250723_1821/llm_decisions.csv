37,74,movement,[30,2],"The agent can see three positions: its current position (30,1) with sugar 1.0, position (30,2) with sugar 1.0, and a distant position (30,50) with sugar 0.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar are (30,1) and (30,2), both with sugar 1.0. However, (30,1) is the current position, and (30,2) is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving to (30,2) does not increase sugar welfare compared to staying, but since the movement rule prioritizes moving to the nearest position with maximum welfare and (30,2) is unoccupied and has equal sugar, the agent should move there."
37,108,movement,[39,5],"The agent is currently at position [34,5] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at position [39,5]. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision (distance 5.0). Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake."
37,30,movement,[13,30],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 2.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [13,30] and [12,31]. Choosing [13,30] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and nearest distance."
37,110,movement,[41,10],"The agent is currently at position [41,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0, available at multiple positions such as [41,10], [40,10], [42,10], and others within vision range. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is at distance 1.0 at [41,10]. Therefore, the agent should move to [41,10] to maximize welfare."
37,113,movement,[28,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [28,3] and [27,4] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since both are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, moving to [28,3] is chosen arbitrarily as it is to the right, maintaining a consistent movement direction."
37,104,movement,[18,43],"The agent is currently at position [16, 42] with sugar value 1.0. All visible positions have sugar values of 3.0 or less, but the agent's vision range is 5 and it can only move to unoccupied positions. The unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value (3.0) are at distances ranging from 2.24 to 5.0. The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is at [18, 43] with distance 2.24. Therefore, the agent should move to [18, 43] to maximize welfare."
37,104,reproduction,[102],"Agent 104 is male, age 20, with sugar 35.5 which is above the minimum required 11.5 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 102, who is female, age 20, with sugar 40.5. Both have empty neighboring sites (agent 104 has positions [19,43],[18,44]; agent 102 has positions [17,42],[16,43],[17,44]). Since the partner is within vision range and fertile, and both have empty adjacent sites, reproduction is possible. Agent 104 can reproduce with up to 2 partners, but only one eligible partner is available. Therefore, agent 104 should reproduce with agent 102."
37,124,movement,[33,11],"The agent is currently at position [33,10]. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0, available at positions [33,11], [32,11], [32,12], [34,13], and [35,13]. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar (3.0) is [33,11] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,11] to maximize welfare."
38,56,movement,[35,13],"The agent is currently at position [36, 11] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 5, and it can see multiple unoccupied positions within this range. Among these, the positions [35, 13], [34, 13], and [32, 11] have the highest sugar value of 4.0. The closest of these is [35, 13] with a distance of 2.24, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [35, 13] to maximize its welfare by collecting more sugar."
38,147,movement,[37,1],"All visible positions within vision have the same sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, the agent can choose any; choosing position [37,1] arbitrarily."
38,93,movement,[32,11],"The agent is currently at position [29,10] with sugar 55.0. All adjacent and visible positions with higher sugar values are occupied. The highest sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at [32,11], which is farther than some other positions with lower sugar values. According to the movement rule, the agent should move to the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar). The nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar is [32,11] with sugar 4.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [32,11]."
38,103,movement,[34,13],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 4.0 at position [34,13]. This position is unoccupied and within vision, and it offers higher welfare than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Therefore, the agent moves to [34,13] to maximize its welfare."
38,103,reproduction,[117,121,56],"The agent 103 is female, fertile, and has enough sugar (56.0) to reproduce. There are three eligible male partners within vision range: agents 117, 121, and 56. Each partner is fertile, of opposite sex, and has empty neighboring sites for the child. The agent also has an empty neighboring site. Since the agent can reproduce with up to 3 partners and all three meet the criteria, reproduction with all three partners is possible and beneficial for genetic diversity. Therefore, the agent should reproduce with partners 117, 121, and 56."
38,171,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [35,8] with sugar value 4.0. All adjacent positions with higher sugar values are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions have sugar values of 3.0 or less, which is less than the current position's sugar value. Therefore, moving would not increase welfare."

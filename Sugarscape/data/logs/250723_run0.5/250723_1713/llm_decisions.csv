23,133,movement,[10,38],"The agent is currently at position [9, 38] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 5. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. Several positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision: [10, 38], [8, 39], [8, 40], [11, 40], [12, 38], [9, 41], [10, 35], [12, 39], [8, 41], [12, 40], [9, 42], [13, 37], [8, 42], [10, 42], [9, 43]. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41: [10, 38] (distance 1.0), [8, 39] (distance 1.41). Both are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [10, 38]. Therefore, the agent should move to [10, 38]."
23,109,movement,[40,13],"The agent is currently at position [40,14] with sugar value 1.0. There are multiple nearby positions with sugar value 3.0 within vision range and none of these positions are occupied. Moving to any of these positions will maximize welfare. The closest such positions are at distance 1.0: [40,13], [41,14], and [40,15]. Choosing [40,13] as the target position for movement as it is unoccupied and provides maximum sugar value within the nearest distance."
23,14,movement,[13,32],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0, so moving to any of these positions will maximize welfare. Choosing position [13,32] as it is unoccupied, has maximum sugar value, and is nearest."
23,66,movement,[37,6],"The agent is currently at position [37,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances ranging from 1.0 to 4.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [37,6] and [36,6], both within vision range and unoccupied. Choosing the closest position [37,6] to maximize welfare and minimize movement cost."
23,50,movement,[15,42],"The agent is currently at position [12, 41] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [15, 42] with sugar 4, which is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare as it has the highest sugar value among unoccupied positions within vision."
23,121,movement,[34,14],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0: [34,14], [36,14], and [35,15]. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these is equally beneficial. Choosing [34,14] arbitrarily as the target position."
23,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
23,124,movement,[31,6],"The agent is currently at position [31,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [31,6] and [32,7], both at distance 1.0. Choosing [31,6] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) and unoccupied."
23,31,movement,[16,36],"The agent is currently at position [17, 37] with sugar value 1.0. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance approximately 1.41 (positions [16, 36] and [18, 36]). Both are unoccupied and have the maximum welfare (sugar value) available within vision. The agent will move to the nearest such position, choosing [16, 36]."
23,31,reproduction,[2],"Agent 31 is female, age 24, with sugar 29 which is above the minimum required 20 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 2, who is male, age 24, with sugar 55. Agent 2 has an empty nearby position [17,37], and agent 31 has multiple empty nearby positions. Both agents are fertile and within vision range. Since agent 31 can reproduce with up to 1 partner and the partner meets all criteria, reproduction will occur with agent 2."
23,136,movement,null,"All visible unoccupied positions within vision have the same sugar value of 2.0, which is the maximum welfare available. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0. Since the agent is currently at position [34,2] with sugar value 2.0, moving to any of these positions does not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."
23,119,movement,[36,6],"The agent is currently at position [36,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value on unoccupied positions is 3.0. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [36,6], [35,7], and [35,8], all at distance 1 or 1.41. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [36,6]."
23,29,movement,[40,9],"The agent is currently at position [40, 10] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Several positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and within distance 1 or 1.41, such as [40, 9], [41, 10], [41, 9], [39, 11], and [41, 11]. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [40, 9] and [41, 10]. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [40, 9]."
23,115,movement,[28,9],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are unoccupied. The maximum sugar value available in visible positions is 3.0, and there are multiple positions with this sugar value. The agent chooses the nearest position with sugar value 3.0, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, the position [28,9] is unoccupied and closest. Therefore, the agent moves to [28,9] to maximize its welfare."
23,112,movement,[17,40],"The agent is currently at position [16, 40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [17, 40], [17, 39], and [15, 41], all at distance 1.0 or 1.41. Among these, [17, 40] is unoccupied and closest. Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 40] to maximize welfare."
23,114,movement,[32,7],"The agent is currently at position [33,7] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are [32,7] and [34,7], both with sugar value 3 and at distance 1. Both positions are unoccupied. Moving to either position would maximize welfare. Choosing [32,7] as it is the first found with maximum sugar value and minimum distance."
23,117,movement,[35,8],"The agent is currently at position [36,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. All positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and at distances ranging from 1.41 to 3.61. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [35,8] and [35,10], both at distance 1.41. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [35,8]."
23,118,movement,[16,42],"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0: [16,42], [18,42], and [17,43]. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these is beneficial. Choosing [16,42] as it is the first in the list and unoccupied."
23,74,movement,[28,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [28, 2] and [27, 3] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since both are equally good in terms of welfare and distance, moving to [28, 2] is chosen arbitrarily as it is directly to the right, which is a straightforward move."
23,15,movement,[38,13],"The agent is currently at position [38,14] with sugar value 1.0. All visible positions have sugar value 3.0 except a few with 2.0 and 1.0. The positions with sugar value 3.0 are all unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [38,13] and [38,15]. Choosing [38,13] as it is the closest and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare."

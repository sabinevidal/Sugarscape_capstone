8,80,movement,[35,11],"The agent is currently at position [34, 11] with sugar 25. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values mostly 4 or less. The positions with the highest sugar value of 4 are [35, 11], [35, 10], and [35, 12], all at distances 1.0 or 1.41. Among these, the nearest position with maximum sugar is [35, 11] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [35, 11] to maximize welfare."
8,95,movement,[35,10],"The agent is currently at position [31,8] with sugar value 1. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4 at position [35,10]. This position is within the agent's vision range (distance 4.47) and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake."
8,51,movement,[38,5],"The agent is currently at position [38,6] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions within vision have sugar values mostly 3 or 2, but all positions with sugar value 3 are unoccupied and at distance 1 or 1.41. Since the agent should move to the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value), it will move to one of the adjacent positions with sugar value 3. Among these, positions [38,5], [37,6], and [39,6] are all at distance 1 and unoccupied with sugar value 3. The agent can choose any of these; choosing [38,5] as it is directly north and at minimal distance."
8,31,movement,[13,42],"The agent is currently at position [14, 41] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distances 1.41 ([13, 42]) and 2.0 ([12, 41], [14, 43], [13, 43]). The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3 is [13, 42]. Therefore, the agent should move to [13, 42] to maximize welfare."
8,60,movement,[35,12],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are unoccupied. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [35,12] and [35,13]. Among these, [35,12] is closer (distance 4.12) compared to [35,13] (distance 5.1). Therefore, the agent moves to [35,12] to maximize welfare."
8,55,movement,[30,5],"The agent has a vision of 3 and can see multiple positions with sugar values of 3 that are unoccupied and within its vision range. Since all these positions have the maximum sugar value of 3, the agent should move to the nearest one to maximize welfare. The nearest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1: [30,5], [29,6], and [31,6]. Among these, any can be chosen as they have equal sugar and distance. I choose [30,5] as the target position."
8,46,movement,[18,35],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions are [18,35], [19,36], [17,35], [19,35], [17,37], and [19,37]. Moving to any of these will increase welfare. Choosing [18,35] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
8,70,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
8,12,movement,[33,5],"The agent is currently at position [33,6] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, all at distance 1 or 1.41. Since all these positions have the same sugar value, the agent will move to the nearest one with maximum sugar value 3. The closest such positions are [33,5], [34,6], [33,7], and [32,7], all at distance 1 or 1.41. Among these, [33,5] is directly adjacent and unoccupied, so the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
8,10,movement,null,"The agent's current position and all visible positions within its vision range have sugar values of 0, except for a distant position at [39,1] with sugar value 2. However, this position is too far (distance 44) and likely outside the agent's vision range for movement. Since no nearby unoccupied positions offer any sugar, the agent will not move."
8,81,movement,[29,6],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, but none of the positions with sugar 3.0 are occupied. The agent is currently on a position with sugar value 1.0, so moving to any position with sugar 3.0 will increase welfare. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. Among these, position [29,6] is at distance 1.0 and unoccupied, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare while minimizing distance."
8,62,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare (sugar value), there is no benefit in moving."
8,88,movement,[14,43],"The agent is currently at position [15, 41] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with higher sugar values are all occupied. The visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 are at distances approximately 2.24 to 3.61. The nearest such position is [14, 43] at distance 2.24. Moving there maximizes welfare while being the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value."
8,57,movement,[12,41],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible range. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0 and 2.0. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is at [12, 41] with sugar 3.0 and distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [12, 41]."
8,93,movement,[31,6],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [31,6], [31,7], and [32,7]. Among these, [31,6] is the closest at a distance of 2.0. Therefore, the agent will move to [31,6]."
8,8,movement,[35,13],"The agent is currently at position [36, 11] with sugar value 1. The agent can see several unoccupied positions within its vision range. The position [35, 13] has the highest sugar value of 4 among the visible unoccupied positions and is within the agent's vision. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing its sugar intake."

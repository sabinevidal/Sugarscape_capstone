26,12,movement,[34,7],"The agent's current position is [34,8] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values are all occupied. The highest sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at multiple positions within vision range. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [34,7] and [35,8], both at distance 1. Moving to either would increase the agent's welfare. Choosing [34,7] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
26,2,movement,[19,37],"The agent is currently at position [19, 36] with sugar value 1.0. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [20, 36], [19, 37]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum welfare, the agent will move to [19, 37]."
26,123,movement,[29,2],"The agent can see three positions within its vision: [29,2] with sugar 2.0, [30,3] with sugar 2.0, and its current position [30,2] with sugar 1.0. Both [29,2] and [30,3] have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar, which is either [29,2] or [30,3]. Both are at distance 1, so the agent can choose either. Here, the agent chooses to move to [29,2]."
26,108,movement,[32,12],"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0: [32,12]. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision range. Therefore, the agent should move to [32,12]."
26,115,movement,[30,10],"The agent is currently at position [29,10] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [30,10] at distance 1.0 and [28,9] at distance 1.41. Since [30,10] is closer and unoccupied, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
26,50,movement,[16,43],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at position [16,43], which is within vision and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
26,59,movement,[10,35],"The agent is currently at position [11, 35] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 to 4.12. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [10, 35] at distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare and is the nearest such position."
26,142,movement,[31,8],"The agent is currently at position [31,9] with a sugar value of 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are [31,8] at distance 1 and [28,9] at distance 3. The agent chooses to move to [31,8] as it is the nearest position with the maximum sugar value available."
26,113,movement,[31,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [31,1] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to staying at the current position with sugar value 1.0."
26,5,movement,[19,41],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [19,41] and [18,42]. Choosing to move to [19,41] as it is directly adjacent and provides maximum welfare."
26,104,movement,[17,34],"The agent is currently at position [17,33] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. These positions are [17,34], [15,34], [16,35], [14,34], and [16,36]. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [17,34] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [17,34] to maximize welfare."
26,58,movement,[28,9],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The closest one is at position [28,9] with sugar 3.0 and distance 1.0, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [28,9] to maximize welfare."
26,31,movement,[13,37],"The agent is currently at position [13,36] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0. The agent should move to one of the nearest positions with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. The closest such positions are [13,37] and [14,37], both at distance 1.0 and unoccupied. The agent can choose either; here, it moves to [13,37]."
26,84,movement,[34,6],"The agent is currently at position [35,5] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [34,6], [36,6], [35,7], [38,5], and [35,8]. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are [34,6] and [36,6], both at distance 1.41. Choosing [34,6] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and minimum distance. Moving there will maximize the agent's welfare."
26,110,movement,[37,14],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [38,13] and [37,14]. Choosing [37,14] as it is directly adjacent and closer in vertical direction, which may be more beneficial for future moves."
26,107,movement,[33,1],"The agent can see three positions within its vision range: its current position (32,1) with sugar value 1.0, position (33,1) with sugar value 2.0, and a distant position (32,50) with sugar value 0.0. Among unoccupied positions, (33,1) has the highest sugar value (2.0) and is within vision range. Therefore, the agent should move to (33,1) to maximize welfare."
26,24,movement,[13,44],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0, and all positions with 3.0 sugar are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [13,44] and [14,45]. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar, [13,44], to maximize welfare and minimize movement cost."
26,111,movement,[39,4],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [39,4] and [38,5] have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at a distance of 1.0, which is the minimum distance. Moving to either would maximize welfare. Choosing [39,4] arbitrarily as the target position."
26,121,movement,[32,13],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [32,13] and [33,14]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [32,13] as it is the first found nearest position with maximum sugar value."
26,96,movement,[8,38],"The agent is currently at position [9, 36] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 5. The highest sugar value visible in unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at multiple positions such as [11, 37], [8, 38], [10, 38], [9, 39], [8, 39], [10, 39], [12, 38], [10, 40], and [9, 41]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 2.24: [11, 37], [8, 38], and [10, 38]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar, the agent will move to [8, 38]."

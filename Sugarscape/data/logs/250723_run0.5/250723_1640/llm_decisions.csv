13,2,movement,[17,39],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 4.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 4.0 are at distances 1.41 and 2.24. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 4.0 is at [17, 39] with distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent moves to [17, 39] to maximize its welfare."
13,72,movement,[34,10],"The agent is currently at position [35,10] with sugar value 1. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 4. These positions are [34,10], [33,10], [37,10], and [33,9]. All these positions have sugar value 4 and are at distances 1 or 2. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 4 are [34,10] at distance 1 and [33,10], [37,10], [33,9] at distance 2 or more. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,10] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value and is unoccupied."
13,59,movement,[15,42],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [15,42] and [14,42]. Among these, [15,42] is closer (distance 2.0) compared to [14,42] (distance 3.0). Therefore, the agent moves to [15,42]."
13,8,movement,[34,12],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0, found at positions [34,12], [32,11], and [34,13]. Among these, [34,12] is the closest at a distance of 1.0. Therefore, the agent will move to [34,12]."
13,74,movement,[29,1],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [29,1], [31,1], and [30,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [29,1] arbitrarily as the target position."
13,15,movement,[33,10],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the positions [33,10] and [32,11] both have the highest sugar value of 4.0 and are at a distance of 1.0, which is the nearest maximum welfare. The agent chooses to move to [33,10] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
13,55,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3 or less, which is less than the sugar at the current position (5). Moving to any of these positions would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should stay put to maximize welfare."
13,96,movement,[15,37],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [15,37] and [14,38]. Both are unoccupied and at distances 1.0 and 2.24 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [15,37]. Therefore, the agent will move to [15,37]."
13,42,movement,[25,5],"All visible positions within vision have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent will move to the closest such position to maximize welfare. Among these, positions at distance 1.0 are closest. Choosing position [25,5] as it is one of the closest with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
13,69,movement,[20,37],"All visible positions have the same maximum sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, the agent selects position [20, 37]."
13,5,movement,[17,35],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, the agent can move to any of the adjacent positions with sugar value 3.0 and distance 1.0. The agent chooses to move to position [17, 35], which is unoccupied and has maximum sugar value within vision range."
13,11,movement,[34,5],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [34,5], [35,6], [34,4], and [34,6] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. All are at distance 1 or approximately 1.41. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar, [34,5] or [35,6] at distance 1.0. Selecting [34,5] arbitrarily as the target position to maximize welfare."
13,60,movement,[33,9],"The agent is currently at position [34,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [33,9], [32,9], [37,10], and [32,11]. The closest of these is [33,9] at distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,9] to maximize welfare."
13,17,movement,[10,34],"All adjacent positions have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Choosing to move to position [10, 34] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare."
13,70,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
13,66,movement,[34,3],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The position [34,3] has sugar 3.0 and distance 1.0, and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent will move to [34,3]."
13,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. There is no benefit in moving to any other position as they do not provide higher welfare."
13,50,movement,[14,42],"The agent is currently at position [15, 43] with sugar value 1. The nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value is [14, 42] with sugar value 4, which is at a distance of 1.41. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake."
13,53,movement,[38,9],"The agent is currently at position [36,6] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can move to any unoccupied position within this range. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4 at positions [38,9] and [37,10]. Both positions are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest position with maximum welfare (sugar value 4) is [38,9] with a distance of 3.61, which is closer than [37,10] at distance 4.12. Therefore, the agent should move to [38,9] to maximize welfare."
13,75,movement,[31,1],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [31,1], [33,1], and [32,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally near and have equal sugar, moving to any of these maximizes welfare. Choosing [31,1] arbitrarily as the target."
13,31,movement,[9,41],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [9, 41], which is unoccupied and has maximum sugar value within vision, to maximize welfare."

13,29,movement,[37,10],"The agent is currently at position [35, 11] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [37, 10], [37, 12], and [34, 13], each with sugar value 4. Among these, [37, 10] and [37, 12] are at distance 2.24, and [34, 13] is also at distance 2.24. Since all have the same sugar value and distance, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [37, 10] as the target position for movement."
13,40,movement,[14,38],"The agent is currently at position [18, 39] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4 at [14, 38], but it is at a distance of 4.12 and unoccupied. Other positions with sugar value 3 are closer but have lower sugar. Moving to [14, 38] maximizes welfare as it has the highest sugar value within vision and is unoccupied."
13,10,movement,null,"The agent's vision is 6, and within this range, the only position with sugar is at [39,1] with sugar value 2.0. However, this position is 44 units away, which is beyond the agent's vision range. All other visible positions within vision have zero sugar. Therefore, the agent should not move as there is no better position within vision to move to."

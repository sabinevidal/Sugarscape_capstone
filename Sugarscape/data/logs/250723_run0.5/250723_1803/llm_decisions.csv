34,145,movement,[36,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [36,3], [37,3], and [38,4] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest among these is [36,3] at a distance of 1.0, which is closer than the others. Therefore, moving to [36,3] maximizes welfare by collecting the highest sugar nearby while minimizing movement distance."
34,103,movement,[37,14],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [38,13] and [37,14]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [37,14] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare at minimum distance."
34,140,movement,[12,36],"The agent is currently at position [13, 36] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value available at unoccupied positions is 3.0. These positions are [12, 36], [14, 36], [14, 35], [11, 35], [15, 37], [14, 38], [16, 36], [12, 39], [16, 34], [16, 38], [17, 36], [13, 40], [9, 37], [17, 37], and [13, 41]. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [12, 36] and [14, 36]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing the closest with maximum sugar, the agent will move to [12, 36]."
34,106,movement,[10,39],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available nearby. The agent chooses the closest such position to minimize movement cost. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [10,39] and [12,39]. The agent can move to either. Choosing [10,39] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimal distance."
34,111,movement,[37,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [37,3] and [38,4] have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at a distance of 1.0, so either is equally good. Choosing to move to [37,3] to maximize sugar intake."
34,84,movement,[38,4],"The agent is currently at position [34,5] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 5, and it can see several unoccupied positions with sugar values higher than 1. The highest sugar value among visible unoccupied positions is 3, found at positions [32,8], [34,9], [38,4], and [33,9]. Among these, the closest is [38,4] at a distance of approximately 4.12. Moving to [38,4] maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake while being within vision range and unoccupied."
34,26,movement,[39,5],"The agent has vision 2 and sees several unoccupied positions with sugar value 2.0 at distances 1.0 to 2.0. The maximum sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 2.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [39,5]. Moving there maximizes welfare and is the closest such position."
34,143,movement,[16,34],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0 sugar. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [16,34] and [16,36]. Both are unoccupied and equally good. Choosing to move to [16,34] as it is directly adjacent and provides maximum welfare."
34,7,movement,[12,29],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [12,29] and [14,29] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Both are at distance 1, so either is equally good. Choosing to move to [12,29]."
34,157,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some farther ones with lower sugar values. The agent is currently at position [18,36] which has sugar value 3.0. All adjacent positions with sugar 3.0 are unoccupied and at distance 1 or slightly more. Since the agent should move to the nearest position with maximum welfare (maximum sugar), and the current position has sugar 3.0, moving to any adjacent position with the same sugar value does not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."
34,149,movement,[13,41],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available nearby. The closest such positions are at distance 1.0: [13,41], [15,41], and [14,42]. Choosing [13,41] as it is the first among the closest maximum welfare positions."
34,126,movement,[8,39],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The agent chooses to move to position [8,39], which has sugar value 3.0 and is at distance 1.0, as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare."
34,155,movement,[32,8],"The agent is currently at position [29,7] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0 at positions [32,8], [29,11], [30,11], [33,9], and [31,11]. Among these, [32,8] is the closest with a distance of 3.16. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision range. Therefore, the agent should move to [32,8] to maximize welfare."
34,2,movement,[18,37],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [18,37], [20,37], and [19,38]. All these positions are unoccupied. Choosing the first in the list, [18,37], to move to the nearest maximum welfare position."
34,14,movement,[16,33],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, the positions [16,33] and [14,35] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are at the same distance (1.41). Choosing [16,33] as the target position to maximize welfare while moving closer to the top right area."
34,137,movement,[14,35],"The agent is currently at position [15, 35] with a sugar value of 1. Nearby visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [14, 35], [14, 36], and [16, 36], all at a distance of about 1 to 1.41. Among these, [14, 35] is the closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 35] to maximize welfare."
34,67,movement,[10,40],"The agent is currently at position [9, 39] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [9, 37] at distance 2.0 and [10, 40] at distance 1.41. Since [10, 40] is closer and unoccupied, the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
34,12,movement,[29,11],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at multiple positions such as [29,11], [30,11], [30,12], [31,11], [30,13], [32,11], and [32,12]. Among these, the closest is [29,11] with a distance of 1.41. Therefore, the agent will move to [29,11]."
34,12,reproduction,[80],"Agent 12 is male, age 35, with sugar 15 which is above the minimum required 8 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 80, who is female, age 35, with sugar 47 and has an empty nearby position [28,10]. Agent 12 also has multiple empty nearby positions. Since both have at least one empty adjacent site and the partner is within vision and fertile, reproduction is possible. The max partners allowed is 1, so agent 80 is selected for reproduction."

17,5,movement,[15,37],"The agent is currently at position [16, 36] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [15, 37], [17, 39], and [16, 42]. However, [17, 39] and [16, 42] are occupied or out of vision range for movement. The position [15, 37] is unoccupied and within vision range (distance 1.41). Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 37] to maximize welfare."
17,42,movement,[27,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [27,3], [26,4], [27,4], [28,3], and [26,5] all have the highest sugar value of 2.0. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value (2.0) are at distance 1.0: [27,3] and [26,4]. Choosing [27,3] as the target position because it is the first found with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
17,60,movement,[33,9],"The agent is currently at position [36,6] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [33,9] and [34,10], both with sugar value 4. These positions are unoccupied and within the agent's vision range. Among these, [33,9] is closer (distance 4.24) compared to [34,10] (distance 4.47). Therefore, the agent should move to [33,9] to maximize welfare."
17,88,movement,[14,42],"The agent is currently at position [13, 42] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [14, 42] and [16, 42]. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [14, 42] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 42] to maximize welfare."
17,53,movement,[38,5],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [38,5] and [39,6]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [38,5] as it is the closest and provides maximum welfare."
17,13,movement,[17,39],"The agent is currently at position [19, 40] with 5 sugar. The nearest unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value visible are at [17, 39] and [16, 42], both with sugar value 4. Among these, [17, 39] is closer (distance 2.24) compared to [16, 42] (distance 3.61). Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 39] to maximize welfare while minimizing distance."
17,38,movement,[37,5],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see several positions with sugar values. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0 at positions [37,5], [35,6], and [39,6]. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [37,5] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,5] to maximize welfare."
17,8,movement,[34,10],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 4.0. Among these positions, the closest ones with sugar value 4.0 are at distance 1.0 (position [34,10]). Therefore, the agent moves to position [34,10] to maximize its welfare."
17,23,movement,[37,3],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 2.0. The position [37,3] is at distance 1.0 and unoccupied, so moving there maximizes welfare and is the nearest such position."
17,58,movement,[33,10],"The agent has a vision of 3 and can see several unoccupied positions with sugar values of 4 at distances 1.41, 2.0, and 3.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (4) are at [33,10] (distance 1.41) and [32,9] (distance 2.0). Among these, [33,10] is the closest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,10]."
17,58,reproduction,[60],"Agent 58 is male, age 18, with sugar 51, which is above the minimum sugar required for reproduction (6). The only eligible partner is agent 60, a female age 18 with sugar 55, also fertile and within vision range. Although agent 58 has no empty neighboring positions, agent 60 has empty nearby positions, satisfying the reproduction condition that at least one partner has an empty adjacent site. Therefore, reproduction with agent 60 is possible and chosen. No other partners are available, so only agent 60 is selected."
17,40,movement,[12,38],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [12,38] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
17,80,movement,[34,12],"The agent is currently at position [35,7] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 4. The position [34,12] has the highest sugar value of 4 and is within vision range (distance 5.1). It is unoccupied and closer than other positions with similar sugar values. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,12] to maximize welfare."
17,67,movement,[11,40],"The agent is currently at position [12, 40] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 are [11, 40], [11, 39], and [11, 41], all at distance 1 or approximately 1.41. Among these, [11, 40] is the closest and has the maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions. Therefore, the agent should move to [11, 40]."
17,46,movement,[16,42],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the position [16, 42] has the highest sugar value of 4.0, which is greater than the sugar at its current position (1.0). This position is also within the agent's vision and unoccupied, making it the optimal move to maximize welfare."
17,29,movement,[37,12],"The agent is currently at position [37, 10] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 5, and it can see multiple positions with sugar values higher than its current position. The highest sugar value visible in unoccupied positions is 4 at position [37, 12]. This position is within the agent's vision and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [37, 12] to maximize its welfare by collecting more sugar."
17,37,movement,[39,10],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, such as [39,10]. This position is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake."

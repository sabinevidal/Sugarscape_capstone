36,38,movement,[36,1],"The agent is currently at position [35,1] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [36,1] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied. Therefore, moving to [36,1] maximizes welfare."
36,159,movement,[27,2],"Among the visible positions, [27, 2] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied, making it the best choice for maximizing welfare within vision range."
36,55,movement,[38,8],"The agent is currently at position [38,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0 at positions [38,8], [36,7], [37,5], and [36,8]. All these positions are at distances 1.0 to 2.24, within the agent's vision of 3. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [38,8] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [38,8]."
36,158,movement,[29,13],"The agent is currently at position [28, 11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [29, 13], [31, 13], and [29, 7]. The nearest of these is [29, 7] at a distance of 4.12, [29, 13] at 2.24, and [31, 13] at 3.61. The closest position with maximum sugar value is [29, 13]. Therefore, the agent should move to [29, 13] to maximize welfare."
36,102,movement,[17,44],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [17,44] and [16,45]. Choosing [17,44] as it is the first found with maximum welfare at minimum distance."
36,127,movement,[35,11],"The agent is currently at position [35,12] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are [35,11] and [34,11], both at distance 1.0. Choosing [35,11] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare and minimal movement cost."

The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 2 or 3, with the highest sugar value of 3 at position [29,7]. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision.

There is one eligible partner, agent 66, who is female, age 37, with sugar 27.0. Both have empty neighboring positions (agent 109 has [37,3],[38,4] and agent 66 has [36,5],[37,6]), satisfying the condition for reproduction. Since the max partners is 3 and only one eligible partner is available, agent 66 is selected for reproduction."

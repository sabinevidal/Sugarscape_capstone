31,107,movement,[31,1],"All visible positions within vision have the same sugar value of 1.0, but the current position is occupied by the agent itself and has sugar 1.0. The adjacent positions [31,1] and [33,1] are unoccupied and have the same sugar value. Since the welfare is the same, the agent can move to any of these positions. Choosing to move to [31,1] as it is the first in the list of unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value."
31,114,movement,[33,9],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at [33,9] (distance 1.0), [34,9] (distance 1.41), and [32,12] (distance 2.24). The closest is [33,9] at distance 1.0, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
31,110,movement,[39,10],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [39,10] and [40,11]. Choosing [39,10] as it is directly adjacent and thus the closest position with maximum welfare."
31,133,movement,[8,39],"The agent is currently at position [8,38] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0 at positions [8,39], [9,37], [8,40], [8,41], [11,39], and [8,42]. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are [8,39] at distance 1.0 and [9,37] at distance 1.41. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [8,39]."
31,17,movement,[10,30],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [10, 30] and [11, 31] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is equally good. Choosing to move to [10, 30]."
31,126,movement,[9,37],"The agent's current position is [11, 36] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [9, 37], [11, 39], [14, 37], [15, 36], and [12, 40]. The nearest of these is [9, 37] at distance 2.24, which is closer than the others. Therefore, the agent should move to [9, 37] to maximize welfare."
31,115,movement,[32,12],"The agent is currently at position [28,10]. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at position [32,12]. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [32,12] to maximize welfare."
31,67,movement,[8,41],"The agent is currently at position [9, 41] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0, available at multiple unoccupied positions such as [8, 41], [8, 40], [8, 42], and [10, 42]. These positions are all at a distance of 1.0 to 1.41, which is within the agent's vision and closer than other positions with the same sugar value. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [8, 41]."
31,145,movement,[36,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [36,3] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to the current position with sugar value 1.0 and other nearby positions with lower sugar values or occupied status."
31,66,movement,[37,8],"The agent is currently at position [36,7] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [37,8], [38,7], and [38,6], each with sugar value 3. Among these, [37,8] is the closest at a distance of 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,8] to maximize welfare."
31,53,movement,[34,9],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0, and the closest such position is at [34,9] with a distance of 1.41. Moving there maximizes welfare while being the nearest option."
31,57,movement,[13,41],"The agent is currently at position [13, 42]. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [13, 41] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [13, 41] to maximize welfare."
31,117,movement,[37,11],"The agent is currently at position [35,9] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [52,38,10] with 67 sugar, but this is occupied. The next highest unoccupied visible positions with sugar value 3 are at [37,11], [36,12], [38,7], [37,12], [39,9], [36,13], [38,6], [38,12], [37,13], [40,9], [35,14], [40,10], [34,14], [36,14], [41,9], [35,15]. Among these, the closest is [37,11] at distance 2.83. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,11] to maximize welfare by moving to the nearest position with maximum sugar value available."
31,38,movement,[35,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [35,1], [36,2], and [35,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. They are all at a distance of 1 or approximately 1.41, which is within the agent's vision of 2. The agent will move to one of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [35,1] as it is the closest with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
31,11,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. However, all these positions are unoccupied and at distances 1 or 1.41 from the current position. Since the agent is currently on a position with sugar value 1.0, moving to any other position does not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."
32,141,movement,[30,10],"The agent is currently at position [30,11]. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [30,10] at distance 1.0 and [29,12] at distance 1.41. The agent chooses to move to [30,10] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) and is unoccupied."
32,133,movement,[12,40],"The agent is currently at position [8,39] with sugar 22.5. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at position [12,40], which is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare as it provides the highest sugar value nearby. The agent will move to [12,40]."
32,14,movement,[14,34],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [14,34], [13,35], [12,35], and [11,34] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. All these positions are at distances 1 or 1.41, which are closer than the other positions with lower sugar values. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, [14,34] or [13,35] at distance 1.0. Either is acceptable, but [14,34] is chosen arbitrarily."
32,24,movement,[16,40],"The agent is currently at position [15, 40] with sugar 38.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 4.0. The closest positions with sugar 4.0 are [16, 40] and [16, 41], both unoccupied and at distance 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. Moving to [16, 40] is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) available. Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 40]."
32,85,movement,[37,12],"The agent is currently at position [38,11] with sugar 4.5. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 4.0 at positions [37,12], [36,12], and [36,13]. The nearest of these is [37,12] at distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,12] to maximize welfare."
32,130,movement,[18,39],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within vision range that are not occupied. The maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 4.0 are at distances approximately 2.24 to 3.61. The closest position with maximum sugar (4.0) is at [18,39] with distance 2.24.

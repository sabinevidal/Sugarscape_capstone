2,72,movement,[32,11],"The agent is currently at position [33,11] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar value 4 within its vision range. All these positions with sugar value 4 are unoccupied and at various distances. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 4 are at distance 1 (positions [32,11] and [34,11]). The agent will move to one of these nearest positions with maximum sugar value to maximize welfare. Choosing [32,11] as the target position."
2,80,movement,[40,15],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [40,15] and [39,15]. Both are at distances 5.0 and 6.0 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [40,15]."
2,92,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 2 and can only consider positions within that range. All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 0, which is not better than the current position's sugar value of 0. Therefore, there is no benefit in moving."
2,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have sugar value 0 except the current position which also has sugar value 0. There are no unoccupied positions with higher sugar value within vision. Therefore, the agent should not move."
2,69,movement,[23,46],"All visible positions within vision range have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, any position is equally good, so the agent moves to [23, 46]."
2,75,movement,[42,1],"All adjacent positions have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Choosing to move to position [42,1] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare."
2,29,movement,[37,12],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [37,12] and [36,13]. Both are at distances 3.61 and 4.12 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [37,12]."
2,31,movement,[16,39],"The agent is currently at position [17, 39] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have a sugar value of 4.0, which is the maximum welfare available. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 4.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41, specifically positions [16, 39] and [16, 40]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [16, 39]."
2,40,movement,[15,38],"The agent is currently at position [16, 38] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are all 4.0 units of sugar. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 4.0 are [15, 38] and [15, 39]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum welfare, the agent will move to [15, 38]."
2,39,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have zero sugar value, so there is no welfare gain from moving. The agent will stay in place."
2,38,movement,[37,15],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision range. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [37,15] as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare at the shortest distance."
2,1,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
2,99,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent will stay in place."
2,58,movement,[33,9],"The agent is currently at position [33, 10] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby positions with the highest sugar value (4.0) are unoccupied and within vision range. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 4.0 are at distance 1.0: [33, 9] and [34, 10]. Moving to either would maximize welfare. Choosing [33, 9] as it is directly north and equally close."
2,61,movement,[26,4],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, it can choose any, for example, position [26,4]."
2,12,movement,[33,8],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [33,8] and [34,9]. Among these, [33,8] is closer (distance 5.1) than [34,9] (distance 6.0). Therefore, the agent moves to [33,8]."
2,66,movement,[37,4],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [37,4] and [38,5]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [37,4] as it is the first found with maximum welfare and nearest distance."
2,85,movement,[28,12],"The agent is currently at position [26,14] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with the highest sugar value available and unoccupied are all with sugar value 3. The closest such positions are [28,12], [29,13], [28,11], and [29,12] at distances approximately 2.83 to 3.61. Among these, [28,12] is the nearest position with maximum sugar value 3. Therefore, the agent should move to [28,12] to maximize welfare."
2,91,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
2,56,movement,[38,10],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [38,10] and [37,11], both unoccupied. Among these, [38,10] is closer (distance 4.12) compared to [37,11] (distance 5.0). Therefore, the agent will move to [38,10]."

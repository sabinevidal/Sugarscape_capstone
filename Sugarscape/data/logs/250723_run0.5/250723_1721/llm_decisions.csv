25,122,movement,[13,41],"The agent is currently at position [15, 40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [13, 41] and [18, 41]. Both are at distances 2.24 and 3.16 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [13, 41]. Therefore, the agent should move to [13, 41] to maximize welfare."
25,137,movement,[13,35],"The agent is currently at position [15, 35] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with maximum sugar value of 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision range. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 2.0: [13, 35] and [17, 35]. Both are equally good in terms of sugar and distance. Choosing [13, 35] as the target position to move to maximize welfare."
25,81,movement,[29,11],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available sugar in unoccupied positions. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [29,11], [31,11], and [30,12]. Any of these positions would maximize welfare equally. Choosing to move to [29,11] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."

Nearby positions with higher sugar values (3.0) are available at [17,35], [17,37], [18,37], [19,36], [19,35], [19,37], [18,38], etc. However, many of these positions are occupied. The closest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0 is [17,35] or [17,37]. Both are at distance 1 and unoccupied. The agent will move to [17,35] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) and unoccupied."
25,5,movement,[18,41],"The agent is currently at position [18, 39] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [18, 41] with sugar 4.0 and distance 2.0. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision range. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake. Therefore, the agent should move to [18, 41]."
25,84,movement,[35,5],"The agent is currently at position [36,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible positions, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [35,5] at distance 1.41 and [38,4] at distance 2.0. The agent will move to [35,5] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value)."
25,24,movement,[14,44],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0, and all positions with 3.0 sugar are at distance 1 or slightly more. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [14,44], [16,44], and [15,45]. Since all these positions are unoccupied, the agent can move to any of them. Choosing [14,44] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
25,115,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [29,10] with sugar 25.0. All adjacent positions with higher sugar values are occupied by other agents. The visible unoccupied positions have a maximum sugar value of 3.0, which is lower than the current position's sugar. Therefore, the agent should not move to avoid losing sugar welfare."
25,80,movement,[30,7],"The agent is currently at position [30,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available welfare nearby. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [30,7] (distance 1.0), [31,7] (distance 1.41), and [29,9] (distance 1.41). The agent should move to the nearest position with maximum welfare, which is [30,7]."

All positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and at distances 1.0 to 3.61. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [11, 35] and [12, 36], both at distance 1.0. The agent will move to [11, 35] as it is the closest position with maximum welfare (sugar value 3.0) and unoccupied."
25,135,movement,[34,3],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [34,3] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. It is at a distance of 2, which is within the agent's vision. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other positions with sugar values of 2 or less."
25,8,movement,[33,7],"The agent is currently at position [33,6] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0 at multiple positions: [33,7], [31,7], [32,8], [34,8], [33,9], [30,5], [32,9], and [34,9]. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [33,7] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,7] to maximize welfare."
25,126,movement,[11,38],"The agent is currently at position [11, 39] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except a few with 2.0 or 1.0. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. The closest such positions are at distance 1.0: [11, 38], [10, 39], and [11, 40]. Any of these positions are equally good in terms of sugar value and distance. Choosing [11, 38] as the target position for movement."
25,123,movement,[30,2],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [30, 2] and [31, 3] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Both are at distance 1.0, so either can be chosen. Moving to [30, 2] is selected arbitrarily as it provides maximum welfare and is unoccupied."

Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 (positions [9,40] and [8,41]). Choosing the nearest position with maximum welfare, the agent will move to [9,40]."
25,113,movement,[30,1],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see positions [30,1] and [32,1] both with sugar value 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0.

25,109,movement,[40,11],"The agent is currently at position [40, 12] with sugar value 1.0. All adjacent positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Since all these positions have the same maximum sugar value, the agent will move to the nearest one, which is at distance 1.0. The agent chooses to move to position [40, 11], which is unoccupied and has sugar value 3.0, maximizing welfare within its vision range."
25,134,movement,[30,5],"The agent is currently at position [30,6] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [30,5], [31,7], and [32,8], each with sugar value 3. Among these, [30,5] is the closest (distance 1.0).

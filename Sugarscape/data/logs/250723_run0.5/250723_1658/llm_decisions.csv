19,27,movement,[27,1],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see three positions: its current position (28,1) with sugar 1.0, position (27,1) with sugar 1.0, and a distant position (28,50) with sugar 0.0. Among the unoccupied positions within vision, (27,1) has the maximum sugar value of 1.0, equal to the current position. Since the agent prefers to move to a position with maximum welfare and nearest distance, it can move to (27,1) which is unoccupied and has the same sugar value as the current position."
19,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have sugar value 0 except the current position which also has sugar value 0. Therefore, there is no better position to move to for higher welfare."
19,75,movement,[30,2],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see three positions: its current position (30,1) with sugar 1.0, (30,2) with sugar 2.0, and a distant position (30,50) with sugar 0.0. Among unoccupied positions within vision, (30,2) has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to (30,2) to maximize welfare."
19,40,movement,[12,36],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0, but many of the positions with 3.0 sugar are occupied. The unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 and closest distance are [12,36], [11,37], [13,37], [11,36], [13,36], and [11,38]. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0. Choosing any of these will maximize welfare and is unoccupied. I will choose to move to [12,36] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare at minimum distance."
19,85,movement,[37,10],"The agent is currently at position [37,11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available welfare. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0 or 2.0. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [37,10] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,10] to maximize welfare."
19,8,movement,[34,9],"The agent is currently at position [35,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0 at positions [34,9], [36,9], and [35,10], all at distance 1.0. Since all these positions have equal sugar and distance, the agent can move to any of them. Choosing [34,9] as the target position."
19,108,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar values mostly around 3, but the current position has a sugar value of 4.0. All nearby positions with higher sugar values are occupied. Therefore, the agent should not move as no unoccupied position within vision offers better welfare than the current position."
19,71,movement,[23,32],"All visible unoccupied positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0. Since all these positions have equal maximum sugar value and are unoccupied, the agent will move to one of these nearest positions. Choosing position [23, 32] as it is directly adjacent and has maximum sugar value within vision."
19,56,movement,[36,9],"The agent is currently at position [37,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [36,9] at distance 1.41, [39,8] at distance 2.0, [36,6] at distance 2.24, and [39,7] at distance 2.24. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [36,9]. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,9] to maximize welfare."
19,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
19,23,movement,[37,4],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [37,4] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is at a distance of 1.41, which is the maximum welfare position available. Therefore, the agent should move there to maximize sugar intake."
19,90,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is lower than the sugar at the current position (26.0). Moving to any of these positions would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should stay in place."
19,100,movement,[19,41],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [19,41], [20,42], and [19,43]. Since all are equally good in sugar and distance, moving to any of these is beneficial. Choosing [19,41] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
19,112,movement,[17,42],"The agent is currently at position [16, 42] with sugar value 2.0. All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [17, 42]. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within the agent's vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 42]."
19,15,movement,[37,13],"The agent is currently at position [36, 13] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [37, 13] at distance 1.0, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [37, 13] to maximize welfare."
19,87,movement,[16,34],"The agent can move to position [16, 34] which has the highest sugar value (3.0) among the unoccupied visible positions within its vision range. Positions [17, 33] and [17, 35] are occupied, and [18, 34] has less sugar (2.0). Moving to [16, 34] maximizes welfare."
19,69,movement,[16,35],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with lower values. The agent will move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. Positions [16,35] and [17,36] are both at distance 1.0 and have sugar 3.0. Choosing [16,35] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
19,57,movement,[13,42],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at various distances. All these positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision range. The closest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.41 (position [13,42]) and 2.24 (positions [12,40], [12,42]). Among these, the nearest position with maximum sugar is [13,42]. Therefore, the agent should move to position [13,42]."
19,30,movement,[11,35],"Among the visible positions, several have the maximum sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [11,35] at distance 1.0 and [11,34], [9,36], [11,36] at distance 1.41. Since [11,35] is the nearest position with maximum sugar and is unoccupied, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
19,101,movement,[39,8],"The agent is currently at position [37,9] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are [39,8] and [35,10], both at a distance of approximately 2.24. Both positions are unoccupied. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value within vision, the agent will move to [39,8]."
19,93,movement,[31,5],"The agent is currently at position [30,5] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions all have sugar value 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are [31,5] and [29,6] at distances 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [31,5]."
19,67,movement,[11,38],"The agent is currently at position [11, 39] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied or out of reach. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [11, 38], [10, 39], and [12, 39], all at distance 1. Among these, any can be chosen as they have equal sugar and distance. I choose to move to [11, 38] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, maximizing welfare."
19,111,movement,[38,4],"The agent is currently at position [37,5] with sugar value 2. Nearby positions with higher sugar values are [38,4] and [36,6], both with sugar value 3. These positions are unoccupied and within the agent's vision range. Moving to either position would maximize welfare. Choosing [38,4] as it is closer (distance 1.41) and unoccupied."
20,14,movement,[14,34],"Among the visible positions, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with lower values. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [14,34] and [13,35]. Since both have the same sugar and distance, moving to [14,34] is chosen arbitrarily. Moving to this position maximizes welfare by collecting the highest sugar nearby within vision range."

3,64,movement,[29,6],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [29,6] and [30,7]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [29,6] as it is directly adjacent and provides maximum welfare within vision."
3,80,movement,[36,13],"The agent is currently at position [40, 15] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [36, 13] with 4 sugar, which is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare as it provides the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions within vision."
3,51,movement,[37,9],"The agent is currently at position [38,9] with sugar value 5.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 4.0, but all these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. The closest positions with sugar value 4.0 are at distance 1.0 or slightly more. Since the agent should move to the nearest position with maximum welfare (maximum sugar), it will move to one of the positions with sugar 4.0 at distance 1.0. The position [37,9] is unoccupied and has sugar 4.0 at distance 1.0, so the agent will move there."
3,8,movement,[33,15],"The agent is currently at position [33,16] with 14 sugar. The visible positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 3.0, but all these positions are unoccupied and at a distance of 1 or more. Since the agent should move to the nearest position with maximum welfare (maximum sugar), it will move to one of the positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1. The positions [33,15], [32,16], and [34,16] all have sugar 3.0 and distance 1.0. Choosing [33,15] as it is directly north and closest. Moving there will increase the agent's sugar intake compared to staying put."
3,5,movement,[12,40],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at position [12, 40]. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision. Therefore, the agent will move to [12, 40] to maximize its welfare."
3,27,movement,[35,1],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [35,1], [37,1], and [36,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. All are at distance 1, so the agent can move to any of these to maximize welfare. Choosing [35,1] arbitrarily among these options."
3,43,movement,[42,8],"The agent is currently at position [45,8] with sugar value 1.0. There is a position at [42,8] with the highest sugar value of 3.0 within vision range and it is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare as per the movement rule."
3,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Moving to any other position does not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."
3,93,movement,[25,5],"The agent has a vision of 4 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 2.0 at distance 1.0, which is the maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions. Among these, the agent can move to any of the positions [25,5], [26,6], or [25,7]. Since [26,6] is occupied, it is not a valid move. The agent chooses to move to [25,5], which is unoccupied and has maximum sugar value at the nearest distance."
3,97,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Moving to any of these positions does not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should stay in place."
3,4,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
3,58,movement,[34,10],"The agent is currently at position [33,9] with sugar value 1. There are several unoccupied positions within vision that have a higher sugar value of 4. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 4 are [34,10] at distance 1.41 and [35,9] at distance 2. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [34,10]."
3,1,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
3,81,movement,[28,8],"The agent is currently at position [29,8] with sugar value 1.0. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [28,8], [30,8], and [29,9]. The agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [28,8] as it is the first in the list of closest maximum sugar positions."
3,55,movement,[32,6],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the vision range. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [32,6] and [31,7]. Choosing [32,6] as it is the first encountered with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
3,65,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have the same sugar value of 1.0 and are unoccupied. The agent is currently at position [2,36] which also has sugar value 1.0. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
3,17,movement,[12,42],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [12,42], [11,43], and [12,44] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar and equal distance, moving to any of these maximizes welfare. Choosing [12,42] arbitrarily among these options."
3,90,movement,[19,36],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0. Among these, any can be chosen as they provide equal welfare and are equally near. I choose to move to position [19,36], which is unoccupied and has maximum sugar value within vision."
3,73,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0 and are unoccupied. The agent is currently on a position with sugar value 1.0 at distance 0.0. Since moving to any other position does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place to avoid unnecessary movement."
3,7,movement,[10,38],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [10, 38] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare according to the movement rule."
3,16,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
3,10,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [39, 45] with sugar value 0.0. All visible positions within vision range have sugar value 0.0 except for a distant position [39, 1] with sugar value 2.0, which is too far (distance 44.0) to move to in one step. The agent can only move to adjacent unoccupied positions. Since all adjacent positions have sugar value 0.0 and are unoccupied, the agent will not move as moving does not increase welfare."
3,49,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent should stay in place."
3,29,movement,[36,12],"The agent is currently at position [37,12] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with the highest sugar value available and unoccupied are at distance 1: [36,12] and [36,11], both with sugar value 4. Moving to either position increases welfare significantly. Choosing [36,12] as it is the closest and has maximum sugar value among unoccupied positions within vision."
3,75,movement,[41,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, positions [41,1] and [42,2] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to [41,1] as it is the first maximum welfare position found."
3,38,movement,[37,14],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0 and one adjacent position with 2.0. Since the agent wants to maximize welfare and all unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value are at distance 1 or 1.41, the agent will move to one of the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0. Choosing position [37,14] which is at distance 1 and has sugar value 3.0."
3,19,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position also has zero sugar. Since no position offers better welfare, the agent will not move."
3,42,movement,[25,11],"All visible positions within vision have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, any position is equally good, so the agent moves to [25,11]."

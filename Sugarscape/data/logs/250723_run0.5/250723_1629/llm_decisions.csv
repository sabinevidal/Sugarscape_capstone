9,54,movement,[15,42],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [15,42] and [17,43]. Both are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar, the agent will move to [15,42]."
9,73,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the agent is already on a position with maximum sugar value and all nearby positions are occupied or have equal sugar, there is no benefit in moving."
9,14,movement,[13,34],"All visible positions have the same maximum sugar value of 3.0. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0. Since all these positions are unoccupied, the agent can move to any of them. Choosing position [13,34] as it is directly north and at distance 1.0 with maximum sugar value."
9,51,movement,[38,4],"The agent is currently at position [38,5] with sugar value 1.0. All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0 or 2.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, such as [38,4], [37,5], and [39,5]. These positions are unoccupied and within vision. The agent will move to one of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [38,4] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
9,17,movement,[10,38],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [10,38], [9,39], and [11,39] all have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Since all are equally near and have the same sugar value, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [10,38] as the target position."
9,81,movement,[30,7],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0, which is the maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions. Among these, the closest position is [30,7] with a distance of 1.41. Moving there maximizes welfare by collecting the highest sugar nearby while being unoccupied."
9,69,movement,[20,41],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for two with lower sugar values (2.0 and 1.0). Among the positions with sugar value 3.0, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0: [20,41], [19,42], and [21,42]. Since [19,42] is occupied, it is excluded. Between [20,41] and [21,42], both have equal sugar and distance, so choosing [20,41] arbitrarily. Moving there maximizes welfare within vision and is unoccupied."
9,70,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
9,11,movement,[33,4],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value visible is 3.0 at position [33,4], which is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare as it provides the most sugar within the agent's vision range."
9,60,movement,[33,10],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are unoccupied. The maximum sugar value available in visible positions is 4.0 at positions [33,10], [32,11], and [32,9]. Among these, [33,10] is the closest with a distance of 2.83. Therefore, the agent moves to [33,10] to maximize its welfare."
9,26,movement,[42,9],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among the positions with sugar value 3.0, the nearest ones are at distance 1.0: [42,9] and [41,10]. Both are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value within vision. Choosing to move to [42,9] as it is directly north and equally beneficial."
9,85,movement,[32,9],"The agent is currently at position [35,7] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 4, with the highest sugar value being 4 at position [32,9]. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision range. Moving to [32,9] will maximize the agent's welfare by moving to the position with the highest sugar value available within vision and unoccupied."
9,39,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
9,24,movement,[16,40],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar are [16,40] and [16,39]. Choosing [16,40] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare."
9,3,movement,[35,5],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [35,5] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other available positions."
9,62,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any increase in sugar value and all adjacent positions are unoccupied, the agent can stay in place to conserve energy."
9,87,movement,[21,39],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [21,39], [20,40], and [22,40] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [21,39] arbitrarily as the target position."
9,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
9,5,movement,[17,37],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0: [17,37] and [18,38]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [17,37] as it is directly adjacent and equally beneficial."
9,31,movement,[12,42],"All adjacent positions with higher sugar values are occupied. The visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0: [12,42], [14,42], and [13,43]. Any of these positions would maximize welfare and are unoccupied. Choosing [12,42] as the target position for movement."
9,77,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare, there is no benefit in moving."
9,30,movement,[12,40],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum welfare, which is any of the adjacent positions with sugar value 2.0 at distance 1.0. Choosing position [12,40] as it is the first in the list of nearest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
9,93,movement,[31,5],"The agent is currently at position [31,6] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3, and several such positions are available at distance 1 or slightly more. Among these, positions [31,5], [32,6], and [31,7] are at distance 1 and have sugar value 3. All these positions are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is any of these three. Choosing [31,5] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
9,96,movement,[12,38],"The agent is currently at position [12, 39]. All adjacent positions with higher sugar values are occupied. The visible unoccupied positions all have a sugar value of 3, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1 (positions [12, 38] and [11, 39]). Choosing to move to [12, 38] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, maximizing welfare and minimizing movement distance."

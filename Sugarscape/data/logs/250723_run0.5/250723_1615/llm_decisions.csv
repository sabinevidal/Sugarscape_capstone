5,92,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see positions with sugar values mostly 0 within this range. The current position and all nearby positions within vision have sugar value 0 and are unoccupied. Since no position within vision offers higher sugar value than the current position, the agent will not move."
5,11,movement,[33,3],"The agent is currently at position [34,3] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0 at positions [33,3], [35,3], [33,4], and [35,4]. All these positions have the same sugar value and are at distances 1.0 or 1.41. The nearest positions with maximum sugar are [33,3] and [35,3] at distance 1.0. Choosing [33,3] as the target position to move to maximize welfare."
5,7,movement,[10,36],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [10,36], [9,37], and [11,37] all have the highest sugar value of 3.0. They are all at the same distance (1.0). Choosing to move to [10,36] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare."
5,85,movement,[32,9],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar values mostly at 3. The highest sugar value visible in unoccupied positions is 4 at position [32,9], which is within vision and unoccupied. This position is also closer than other positions with similar sugar values. Therefore, moving to [32,9] maximizes welfare by moving to the nearest position with the highest sugar value available."
5,54,movement,[17,39],"The agent is currently at position [17, 40] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are those with sugar_value 4 at positions [17, 39] and [13, 42]. Among these, [17, 39] is closer (distance 1.0) and unoccupied, while [13, 42] is farther (distance 4.47). Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 39] to maximize welfare by moving to the nearest position with the highest sugar value available."
5,36,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since no position offers better welfare, the agent will not move."
5,56,movement,[38,10],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0. Among these, positions [38,10], [37,11], [39,11], and [38,12] are unoccupied and at distance 1.0. Moving to any of these will increase welfare. Choosing [38,10] as it is directly north and unoccupied."
5,49,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have zero sugar value, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying in place conserves energy and avoids unnecessary movement."
5,10,movement,null,"The agent's current position has a sugar value of 0.0, and all visible positions within vision range also have a sugar value of 0.0 except for one position at [39,1] which has a sugar value of 2.0 but is at a distance of 44.0, which is beyond the agent's vision range of 6. Therefore, there is no better position within vision range to move to. The agent will stay in its current position."
5,93,movement,[30,5],"The agent has a vision of 4 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value visible is 3.0 at position [30,5], which is at distance 4.0. This position is unoccupied and within vision range. Therefore, the agent should move to [30,5] to maximize welfare."
5,37,movement,[34,9],"The agent is currently at position [36,9] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values (3.0) are available at distances 2.0 to 6.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value is at [34,9] or [38,9], both with sugar value 3.0 and distance 2.0. Choosing [34,9] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and nearest distance."
5,95,movement,[31,10],"The agent is currently at position [32, 10] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range and not occupied, all have sugar value 3.0, which is higher than the current position. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [31, 10] and [32, 11]. Both are unoccupied and have the maximum welfare (sugar value) available nearby. The agent will move to the closest such position, [31, 10]."
5,6,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0 and are unoccupied. The agent is currently at position [24,29] which already has a sugar value of 1.0. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
5,75,movement,[39,1],"Among the unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [39,1], [41,1], and [40,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all have equal sugar value and distance, moving to any of these is equally beneficial. I choose to move to [39,1] arbitrarily."
5,96,movement,[13,42],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at position [13, 42], which is at a distance of 2.83. No other unoccupied position has a higher sugar value. Therefore, the agent moves to [13, 42]."
5,66,movement,[35,6],"The agent is currently at position [35,7] with sugar value 1. All visible unoccupied positions have sugar value 3 or 2, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The closest such position is [35,6] at distance 1.0 with sugar value 3. Moving there maximizes welfare and is the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar."
5,3,movement,[34,6],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [34,6] and [33,7] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Since both are equally good in terms of welfare and distance, moving to [34,6] is chosen arbitrarily as it is to the right of the current position."
5,5,movement,[11,38],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [11,38], [10,39], and [12,39]. All these positions are unoccupied. Choosing the closest one, [11,38], to maximize welfare and minimize movement cost."
5,34,movement,[9,31],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [9,31] and [8,32] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is equally good. Choosing to move to [9,31]."
5,19,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
5,2,movement,[12,39],"The agent is currently at position [13,40] with sugar value 1. All visible positions have sugar value 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.41: [12,39] and [12,41]. Both are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to [12,39], which is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) and unoccupied."
5,18,movement,[41,13],"The agent is currently at position [41,14] with sugar value 1.0. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or 2.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The agent will move to one of these nearest positions with sugar value 3.0. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [41,13] and [40,14], both at distance 1.0. Choosing [41,13] for movement."
5,72,movement,[37,11],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 2.0 (e.g., [37,11]). Since these positions are unoccupied, moving to the nearest position with maximum sugar welfare is optimal."
5,13,movement,[16,36],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0, such as (16,36), (17,37), (15,36), and (17,36). Among these, (16,36) is directly adjacent and unoccupied, so moving there maximizes welfare and is the nearest position with maximum sugar."
5,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."

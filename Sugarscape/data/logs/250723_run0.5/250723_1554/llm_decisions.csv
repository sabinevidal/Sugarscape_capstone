0,73,movement,null,"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 1.0, and the current position also has sugar value 1.0. Since moving does not increase welfare and all nearby positions are equally good but occupied or not better, the agent will stay in place."
0,51,movement,[45,5],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 2.0 are at distance 1.41 (e.g., [45,5]). These positions are unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [45,5]."
0,18,movement,[48,18],"The agent is currently at position [50, 21] with 0 sugar at its position and nearby positions within vision have sugar values of 1.0 at distances around 3.61 to 5.0. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value within its vision that is unoccupied. The positions [48, 18] and [47, 19] both have sugar value 1.0 and distance 3.61, which is the maximum sugar value available within vision and closest distance. Choosing [48, 18] as the target position to move to."
0,7,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have the same sugar value of 3.0. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare, the agent will not move."
0,29,movement,[41,14],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 within its vision range. All these positions are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value available in the visible area. Among these, the closest position with maximum sugar is at [41,14] with a distance of 2.24, which is closer than other positions with the same sugar value. Therefore, the agent should move to [41,14] to maximize its welfare."
0,4,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
0,96,movement,[4,43],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 2.0 within its vision range. All these positions are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value available in the visible area. Among these, the closest position with maximum sugar is at coordinates [4, 43] with a distance of 2.24. Therefore, the agent should move to [4, 43] to maximize its welfare."
0,97,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar and are either occupied or have no better sugar value than the current position. Therefore, the agent should not move."
0,76,movement,[24,28],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 1.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [24,28] and [25,29]. Choosing to move to [24,28] as it is the first encountered with maximum welfare and nearest distance."
0,19,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position is also zero sugar. Since no position offers better welfare, the agent will not move."
0,15,movement,[28,19],"The agent has a vision of 4 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 2.0, which is the maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 2.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is at [28,19] with sugar 2.0 and distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [28,19] to maximize welfare."
0,71,movement,[28,32],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 1.0, which is the maximum available. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.41: [28,32]. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare. Therefore, the agent should move to [28,32]."

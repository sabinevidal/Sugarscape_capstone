33,15,movement,[36,8],"The agent has a vision of 4 and can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances ranging from 1.0 to 4.0. Since the agent must move to the nearest position with maximum welfare (maximum sugar), it will choose one of the positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0. The unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 at distance 1.0 are [36,8] and [35,9]. Both are equally good, so the agent can move to either. Choosing [36,8] arbitrarily."
33,128,movement,[31,6],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distances 1.0, 1.41, and 2.24. The closest is at position [31,6] with sugar 3.0 and distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare while minimizing distance."
33,42,movement,[29,1],"The agent is currently at position [29, 2] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby positions with higher sugar values (16.0 to 55.0) are all occupied. The only unoccupied visible positions within vision range have sugar values of 2.0 at positions [29, 1], [28, 2], [28, 3], and [29, 4]. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0 ([29, 1] and [28, 2]). Choosing [29, 1] as it is directly above and equally close."
33,146,movement,[28,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [28,3] and [29,4] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since both are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, moving to [28,3] is chosen arbitrarily as it is to the left, maintaining variety in movement."
33,93,movement,[31,3],"The agent is currently at position [30,3] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby visible positions within vision range have sugar values of 2.0 but many are occupied. The unoccupied positions with sugar value 2.0 are [31,3], [30,4], [29,4], [31,4], [32,3], [30,5], [28,2], [32,2], [28,4], [29,5], [28,5], [27,3], [33,3], [33,2], [27,4], [26,3], and [30,7]. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [31,3] and [30,4]. Choosing [31,3] as it is the nearest position producing maximum welfare and unoccupied."
33,132,movement,[32,6],"The agent is currently at position [32,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at position [32,6], which is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare."
33,133,movement,[11,40],"The agent is currently at position [12, 40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41, such as [11, 40] and [11, 41]. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [11, 40]."
33,105,movement,[17,33],"The agent is currently at position [17,34] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value (3.0) are all at a distance of 1 to 5. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [17,33] and [16,35], both at distance 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. However, [17,33] is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value within vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [17,33]."
33,109,movement,[40,7],"The agent is currently at position [39,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0, available at multiple positions such as [40,7], [38,6], [40,6], [38,8], and [40,8]. All these positions are at a distance of approximately 1.41 or 1.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar value is [40,7] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [40,7] to maximize welfare."
33,96,movement,[12,37],"The agent is currently at position [12, 38] with a sugar value of 1. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [12, 37] (distance 1.0), [12, 36] (distance 2.0), [11, 36] (distance 2.24), and [13, 36] (distance 2.24). All these positions are unoccupied. The closest position with maximum sugar is [12, 37]. Therefore, the agent should move to [12, 37] to maximize welfare."
33,114,movement,[33,6],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or 2.0, except the current position which has 1.0. The maximum sugar value among unoccupied positions is 3.0, and the nearest such positions are at distance 2.0 or slightly more. The agent chooses to move to one of these positions with sugar value 3.0 and minimum distance, specifically position [33,6], which is unoccupied and has sugar 3.0 at distance 2.0."
33,141,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [30, 10] with sugar value 1.0. All visible positions within vision range have sugar values of 3.0 or 2.0, but all positions with sugar value 3.0 are occupied. The next best sugar value is 2.0, but those positions are also occupied or farther away. Since no unoccupied position within vision has a higher sugar value than the current position, the agent should not move."
33,74,movement,[28,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, positions [28, 2] and [27, 3] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since both are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, moving to [28, 2] is chosen arbitrarily as it is to the right of the current position."
33,84,movement,[34,5],"The agent is currently at position [35,4] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, specifically at positions [34,5], [37,4], [35,6], [37,5], [35,7], [36,7], [38,6], [35,8], and [35,9]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [34,5] at distance 1.41 and [37,4] at distance 2.0. Since [34,5] is closer and unoccupied, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
33,117,movement,[35,10],"The agent is currently at position [37,10] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances ranging from 2.0 to 6.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 2.0: [35,10]. This position is unoccupied and provides the maximum welfare within the agent's vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,10]."
33,120,movement,[35,11],"The agent is currently at position [36,12] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distances approximately 1.41 to 2.24. The closest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0 is [35,11] at distance 1.41. Moving there maximizes welfare gain and is the nearest such position."
33,142,movement,[30,9],"The agent is currently at position [31,5] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values are at distance 1, but they are all occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value are at distance 4.12 with sugar value 3.0, specifically positions [35,6] and [30,9]. Among these, [30,9] is closer in terms of Manhattan distance and within vision range. Therefore, the agent will move to [30,9] to maximize welfare."

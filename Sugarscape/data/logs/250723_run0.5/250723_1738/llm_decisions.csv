29,42,movement,[29,1],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see several positions with sugar value 2.0 at distances 1 and 2. However, positions [27,2] and [29,2] are occupied. The unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value within vision are [29,1] and [28,2], both with sugar value 2.0 and distance 1. The agent chooses to move to [29,1] as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare."
29,123,movement,[28,2],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see three unoccupied positions each with a sugar value of 2.0 at positions [28,2], [30,2], and [29,3]. Since all have equal sugar value and are at the same distance, the agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [28,2] arbitrarily as the target position."
29,122,movement,[14,44],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The closest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar are [14,44] and [13,44] at distance 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. Choosing the closest one [14,44]."
29,57,movement,[12,42],"The agent is currently at position [13, 41] with sugar value 1.0. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3.0 or 2.0, but all positions with sugar 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision. The closest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distances around 1.41 to 3.61. The nearest position with sugar 3.0 is at [12, 42] with distance 1.41, which is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare by moving to the highest sugar value position within vision and is the closest such position."
29,101,movement,[37,10],"The agent is currently at position [37,12]. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [37,10] and [36,9]. Both positions are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [37,10] at a distance of 2.0, which is closer or equal distance compared to [36,9]. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,10] to maximize welfare."
29,117,movement,[36,9],"The agent is currently at position [37,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [36,9] has the highest sugar value of 4.0 and is unoccupied. It is also the nearest position with maximum welfare. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,9]."
29,102,movement,[16,44],"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0. I choose to move to position [16,44], which is unoccupied and has maximum welfare (sugar value 3.0) at the nearest distance."
29,145,movement,[35,3],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [35,3] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other available positions with sugar values of 2.0 or less. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,3]."
29,24,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is significantly lower than the sugar values of occupied neighboring positions. Since the agent can only move to unoccupied positions and none of these offer higher welfare than the current position, it is best to stay put."
29,88,movement,[14,34],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [14,34] as it is one of the closest with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
29,88,reproduction,[14],"Agent 88 is female, age 30, with sugar 23 which is above the minimum required 15 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 14, who is male, age 29, with sugar 32. Both have empty neighboring positions available for placing a child. Since max_partners is 1, agent 14 is selected as the partner for reproduction. This ensures reproduction can occur successfully with available space and sufficient sugar resources."
29,141,movement,[30,6],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can move to any unoccupied position within this range. Among the visible positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is 3.0. The closest such position is [30,6] at distance 1.0 and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [30,6]."
29,12,movement,[32,7],"The agent is currently at position [33,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [32,7] and [34,7]. Both are equally good in terms of sugar and distance. The agent can move to either. Choosing [32,7] arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar."
29,129,movement,[30,14],"The agent is currently at position [29,14] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances ranging from 1.0 to 4.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [30,14] at distance 1.0 and [29,12] at distance 2.0. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [30,14]."
29,128,movement,[31,8],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are not occupied. The maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at positions [31,8], [30,10], and [32,10]. Among these, the closest positions are [31,8] at distance 1.0 and [30,10], [32,10] at distance approximately 1.41. The agent chooses to move to [31,8] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
29,110,movement,[39,12],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [39,12] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
29,146,movement,[28,3],"All adjacent positions have the same sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Moving to any of these positions will maximize welfare. Choosing to move to position [28,3] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value."
29,127,movement,[33,11],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [33,11] and [32,12]. Moving to either will maximize welfare. Choosing [33,11] as it is directly adjacent and equally beneficial."
29,71,movement,[17,34],"The agent is currently at position [18, 34] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0, but some of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [17, 34] and [19, 35], both at distance 1 or slightly more. Among these, [17, 34] is closer (distance 1) and unoccupied, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
29,147,movement,[37,2],"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0 and unoccupied. Moving to any of these positions will maximize welfare. I choose to move to position [37,2] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
29,139,movement,[30,2],"All visible unoccupied positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [30,2] and [31,3]. Choosing [30,2] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar value within vision and unoccupied."

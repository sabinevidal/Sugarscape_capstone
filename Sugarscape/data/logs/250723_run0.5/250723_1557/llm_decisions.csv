0,60,movement,[41,13],"The agent is currently at position [44, 15] with a sugar value of 2.0. All neighboring positions with higher sugar values (3.0) are unoccupied and within vision range. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are [41, 13], [40, 15], [40, 14], [41, 12], [42, 11], and [40, 13]. The nearest one is [41, 13] with a distance of 3.61. Therefore, the agent should move to [41, 13] to maximize welfare."
0,5,movement,[5,35],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. All visible positions have a sugar value of 2.0, which is the maximum available in the visible range. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 2.0 are at distance 2.24 (e.g., [5,35]). Since these positions are unoccupied, the agent will move to the nearest one with maximum sugar value, which is [5,35]."
0,16,movement,null,"All visible unoccupied positions within vision have zero sugar value, including the current position. Therefore, moving does not increase welfare."
0,6,movement,[25,29],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 1.0 except the current position and adjacent ones which have 0.0. Among the positions with sugar 1.0, positions [25,29], [23,27], and [26,30] are unoccupied and at distances 2.24 and 3.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar are [25,29] at distance 2.24 and [23,27] and [26,30] at distance 3.0. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar, the agent should move to [25,29]."
0,23,movement,[31,4],"The agent can see a position at [31,4] with the highest sugar value of 3.0 within its vision range of 2, and this position is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by collecting more sugar."
0,52,movement,[25,15],"The agent is currently at position [22, 15] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 2.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 2.0 at distances ranging from 3.0 to 6.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 3.0: [25, 15] and [25, 14]. Choosing the closest one, [25, 15], to maximize welfare while minimizing movement distance."

Since all these positions are unoccupied and at distances 1 or 2, the nearest positions with maximum sugar are at distance 1: [27,2] and [26,3]. Choosing [27,2] as the target position to move to, as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
0,66,movement,[39,4],"The agent is currently at position [40, 2] with sugar value 2. Nearby positions with the highest sugar value available and unoccupied are at distance 2.24 to 3.16 with sugar value 3. The closest such position is [39, 4] with sugar value 3, which is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake."
0,48,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value and the current position also has zero sugar. Since no position offers better welfare, the agent will not move."
0,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, so moving does not increase welfare. The current position is unoccupied and has the same sugar value as all others, so the agent will stay in place."
0,53,movement,[35,7],"The agent is currently at position [35,4] with sugar value 3. Nearby positions with higher sugar value (4) are at distances around 3 to 5 units, but these positions are unoccupied and within vision. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is any of the positions with sugar value 4 at distance 3.0 to 3.16. Among these, position [35,7] is at distance 3.0 and unoccupied, so the agent moves there to maximize welfare."

0,87,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have the same sugar value of 2.0. The agent is currently at position [20,47] which is unoccupied and has sugar value 2.0. Since moving to any adjacent position does not increase welfare and the current position is unoccupied, the agent will not move."
0,12,movement,[24,9],"The agent has vision 6 and sees multiple positions with sugar value 2.0 at distances between 3.0 and 6.0. All these positions have the maximum sugar value visible (2.0) and are unoccupied. The nearest such position is at [24,9] with sugar 2.0 and distance 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare and is the closest maximum sugar position available."
0,95,movement,[24,12],"The agent's vision is 6, and within this range, the position [24, 12] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied. Other positions have sugar value 1.0 or 0.0. Therefore, moving to [24, 12] maximizes welfare and is the nearest such position."

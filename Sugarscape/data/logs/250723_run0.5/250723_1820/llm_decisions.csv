37,122,movement,[10,44],"The agent is currently at position [10, 43] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are [10, 44], [9, 44], and [11, 44], all at distance 1.0 or 1.41.

The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are at (10,40) and (11,41), both at distance 1.0. Choosing (10,40) as the target position because it is unoccupied, has maximum sugar value within vision, and is nearest."

Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are [37,9] and [39,10], both at distance 1 or slightly more. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar welfare, the agent should move to [37,9]."

37,166,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [36,5] with sugar value 3.0. Among visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at the current position. All other positions with sugar values 2.0 or 1.0 are either occupied or have lower sugar values. Therefore, the agent should not move as it is already at a position with maximum welfare within its vision and unoccupied positions with higher sugar do not exist."
37,111,movement,[35,3],"The agent can move to unoccupied positions within its vision range. Among the visible unoccupied positions, [35,3] and [34,6] have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Both are at distances 1.41 and 2.0 respectively. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar, which is [35,3]."
37,5,movement,[15,41],"The agent is currently at position [15, 39] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0, but all positions with sugar 3.0 are at distances greater than 2 and are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is at [15, 41] with distance 2.0, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 41] to maximize welfare."
37,164,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [39,6] with sugar value 3.0. Nearby positions with higher sugar values are all occupied. The unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values of 3.0 or less. Since the current position has the maximum sugar value available among unoccupied positions, the agent will not move."

Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are [19, 39], [19, 38], and [19, 40], all at distance 1 or approximately 1.41. Choosing the closest one, [19, 39], maximizes welfare and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [19, 39]."
37,14,movement,[16,33],"The agent can see a position at [16,33] with the highest sugar value of 3.0 within its vision range and it is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare."

Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value available on unoccupied positions is 3.0. The nearest unoccupied position with sugar value 3.0 is [31,11] at distance 1.41. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while being the closest such position."

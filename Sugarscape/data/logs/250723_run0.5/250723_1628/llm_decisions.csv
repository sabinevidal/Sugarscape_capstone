8,66,movement,[36,4],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within vision range that are unoccupied. The maximum sugar value available in visible positions is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The agent chooses to move to position [36,4], which is unoccupied, has sugar value 3.0, and is the nearest position with maximum welfare."
8,58,movement,[32,7],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0. Among the positions with sugar value 3.0, the closest ones are at distance 1.0: [32,7] and [32,9]. Both are unoccupied and equally good in terms of sugar. Choosing [32,7] as it is directly above the current position and equally optimal."
8,19,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
8,38,movement,[38,10],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions with the highest sugar value (3.0) are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. Since all these positions are unoccupied, the agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. The possible positions at distance 1.0 with sugar 3.0 are [38,10] and [39,11]. The agent can choose either; here, it chooses [38,10]."
8,29,movement,[37,13],"The agent is currently at position [36, 13] with sugar value 1.0. All visible unoccupied positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [37, 13] and [36, 14]. Both are unoccupied and have the maximum welfare (sugar value) available within vision. The agent will move to the nearest such position, which is [37, 13]."
8,54,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [16, 42] with sugar 12. The visible positions within vision range all have a sugar value of 3 or less, which is lower than the agent's current sugar. Moving to any of these positions would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."
8,26,movement,[42,10],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [42,10] and [41,11]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [42,10] as it is directly above the current position and equally optimal."
8,17,movement,[10,39],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [10,39] and [9,40] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is equally good. Choosing [10,39] arbitrarily as the target position to maximize welfare."
8,77,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is equal to the current position's sugar value. Since the agent is already on a position with maximum welfare (sugar value 1.0) and moving would not increase welfare, the agent will not move."
8,63,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying in the current position is optimal."
8,64,movement,[34,9],"The agent is currently at position [35,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at various distances. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [34,9] at distance 1.41 and [35,6] at distance 2.0. The closest is [34,9]. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,9] to maximize welfare."
9,56,movement,[37,12],"The agent is currently at position [36,10] with sugar 12. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4.0 at multiple locations, but some of these are occupied or too far. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value is [37,12] with sugar 4.0 and distance 2.24, which is within vision and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to staying at the current position with sugar 12 (which is not a position to move to, but current position). Therefore, the agent should move to [37,12]."
9,29,movement,[34,13],"The agent is currently at position [37,13] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with higher sugar values are at [34,13] with 4 sugar, but it is 3 units away. Positions at distance 1 or 1.41 have sugar value 3, which is less than 4. The position [34,13] is unoccupied and within vision range. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,13] to maximize welfare by moving to the nearest position with the highest sugar value available."
9,38,movement,[38,9],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [38,9], [37,10], and [39,10]. Choosing to move to [38,9] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
9,13,movement,[17,39],"The agent is currently at position [18, 39] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [17, 39] and [15, 37], both with sugar value 4. Among these, [17, 39] is closer (distance 1.0) compared to [15, 37] (distance 3.61). However, [17, 39] is unoccupied and within vision range, so the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
9,2,movement,[15,37],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the position [15, 37] has the highest sugar value of 4.0, which is greater than the sugar at its current position (1.0). This position is also unoccupied and within the agent's vision. Therefore, the agent will move to [15, 37] to maximize its welfare."
9,71,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the agent is already on a position with maximum welfare (sugar value 1.0) and no other position offers higher sugar, the agent will not move."
9,12,movement,[33,9],"The agent is currently at position [33,5] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [33,9], [32,9], and [33,10]. These positions are unoccupied and within the agent's vision. The nearest of these is [33,9] at a distance of 4.0, which is closer than the others. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by moving to the highest sugar value position within vision and unoccupied."
9,66,movement,[35,3],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except a few with 2.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.41, specifically positions [35,3], [37,3], [35,5], and [37,5]. Choosing the closest among these, any of these four positions is equally good. I will choose [35,3] as the target position to move to, as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision range."
9,27,movement,[29,1],"Among the unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [29,1], [31,1], and [30,2] all have the highest sugar value of 2.0. They are all at distance 1, so any of these positions would maximize welfare. Choosing to move to [29,1] arbitrarily among these options."
9,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0 except the current position which also has 0 sugar. Therefore, there is no better position to move to for increasing welfare."
9,100,movement,[18,42],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [18,42] and [17,43]. Moving to either will maximize welfare. Choosing [18,42] arbitrarily."

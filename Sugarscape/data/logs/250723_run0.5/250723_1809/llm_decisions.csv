35,137,movement,[13,35],"The agent is currently at position [14, 35] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [13, 35], [14, 36], [15, 36], [14, 37], [13, 37], [17, 35], [15, 38], and [12, 38]. The closest among these is at distance 1.0, positions [13, 35] and [14, 36]. Choosing [13, 35] as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar value within vision range."
35,38,movement,[35,1],"The agent can move to any of the visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. All these positions have a sugar value of 2.0, which is the maximum welfare available in the visible unoccupied positions. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [35,1] and [36,2]. The agent chooses to move to [35,1] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
35,129,movement,[30,14],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The maximum sugar value available in these positions is 3.0, found at positions [30,14], [31,14], [31,16], and [32,14]. Among these, the closest position is [30,14] at a distance of 1.0. Therefore, the agent moves to [30,14] to maximize its welfare."
35,90,movement,[15,38],"The agent is currently at position [16, 39] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar value 3 within its vision range. All these positions are unoccupied and at various distances. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are at distance 1.41: [15, 38] and [17, 40]. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value and shortest distance, the agent will move to [15, 38]."
35,149,movement,[12,41],"The agent is currently at position [13, 41] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [12, 41] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [12, 41] to maximize welfare."
35,142,movement,[29,6],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 3.0 at positions [29,6], [31,8], and [31,7]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 2.0 ([29,6] and [31,8]). The agent chooses to move to [29,6] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar) and is unoccupied."
35,145,movement,[36,2],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see several unoccupied positions with sugar value 2.0 at distances 1.0 and 1.41. Since all these positions have the same maximum sugar value within vision, the agent will move to the nearest one with sugar 2.0, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, the position [36,2] is unoccupied and closest, so the agent moves there to maximize welfare."
35,53,movement,[35,14],"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: (36,13) and (35,14). Both are unoccupied. Choosing (35,14) as it is directly adjacent and closer in terms of grid movement."
35,12,movement,[31,7],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 3.0 at multiple positions: [31,8], [31,14], [32,14], and [31,7]. Among these, the closest positions are [31,8] and [31,7] at a distance of approximately 4.47, which is closer than the others. The agent chooses to move to [31,7] as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare (sugar) within its vision."
35,133,movement,[10,41],"The agent is currently at position [11, 41] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [10, 41] (distance 1.0) and [12, 40] (distance 1.41). Both are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [10, 41]."
35,115,movement,[31,14],"The agent is currently at position [31, 15] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values mostly 2.0 or 3.0. The maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions within vision is 3.0 at positions [31, 14], [31, 16], [32, 14], [32, 16], [33, 16], [33, 17], [34, 16], [34, 17], [35, 15], [35, 16], [35, 17], [36, 15], [36, 16], and [37, 15]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [31, 14] and [31, 16] at distance 1.0. The agent will move to [31, 14] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) and is unoccupied."
35,67,movement,[9,40],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0 and 2.0. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are at [9,40] (distance 1.0) and [8,40], [12,40] (distance 2.0). The agent chooses to move to [9,40] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (sugar 3.0)."
35,24,movement,[12,40],"The agent is currently at position [13, 40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0 ([12, 40]) and 2.24 ([12, 38]). The closest position with maximum sugar value is [12, 40]. Therefore, the agent should move to [12, 40] to maximize welfare."
35,110,movement,[41,8],"The agent is currently at position [40,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 to 3.16. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [41,8] at distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare while being the nearest such position."
35,96,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have sugar values of 3.0 or less, which is less than the sugar at the current position (23.5). Moving to any of these positions would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."
35,71,movement,[17,35],"The agent is currently at position [18, 35] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values of 3.0 at positions [17, 35], [19, 34], and [19, 36]. These positions have the highest sugar value available within the agent's vision and are unoccupied. Among these, the closest position is [17, 35] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 35] to maximize welfare."
35,71,reproduction,[105],"Agent 71 is female, age 36, with sugar 31.0, which is above the minimum sugar required for reproduction (15.0). There is one eligible partner, agent 105, who is male, age 18, with sugar 51.0, and has empty neighboring positions. Both agents have empty adjacent sites, satisfying the reproduction conditions. Since max_partners is 2 and only one eligible partner is available, agent 105 is selected for reproduction."
35,14,movement,[16,32],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value to minimize movement cost, the agent will move to position [16, 32]."
35,126,movement,[8,40],"The agent is currently at position [8, 39]. The nearest unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value within vision are at [8, 40] and [8, 42], both with sugar value 3.0 and distances 1.0 and 3.0 respectively. Since [8, 40] is closer and unoccupied, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."

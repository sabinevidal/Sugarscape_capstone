32,149,movement,[14,37],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [14,37] and [15,38]. Both are at distances 2.0 and 3.16 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [14,37]. Therefore, the agent moves to [14,37] to maximize welfare."
32,59,movement,[10,35],"The agent is currently at position [9, 36] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [10, 35] at distance 1.41, [9, 38] at distance 2.0, [11, 34] at distance 2.83, and others further away. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [10, 35]. Therefore, the agent should move to [10, 35] to maximize welfare."
32,80,movement,[28,8],"The agent is currently at position [29,9] with sugar 1.0. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see several unoccupied positions within this range. Among these, the position [28,8] has a sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied, which is the highest sugar value available within the agent's vision. Moving there will maximize the agent's welfare by increasing its sugar intake."
32,80,reproduction,[12],"Agent 80 is female, age 33, with sugar 58 which is above the minimum required 10 for reproduction. The eligible partner is agent 12, male, age 32, with sugar 24. Agent 12 is within vision range and fertile. Both agent 80 and agent 12 have empty neighboring positions, satisfying the reproduction conditions. Since max_partners is 3 and only one eligible partner is available, agent 12 is selected for reproduction."
32,120,movement,[36,12],"The agent is currently at position [30,12] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at position [36,12], but it is at distance 6.0, which is at the edge of vision. There are no other unoccupied positions with higher sugar value closer than that. Therefore, the agent will move to [36,12] to maximize welfare."
32,56,movement,[32,13],"The agent is currently at position [32, 11] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values are all occupied.

Among these, the nearest with maximum sugar is [32, 13] at distance 2.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [32, 13]."
32,66,movement,[38,7],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.41. Choosing to move to position [38,7], which is unoccupied and has maximum sugar value, to maximize welfare."
32,103,movement,[36,13],"The agent is currently at position [36,11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [36,13] has the highest sugar value of 4.0 and is unoccupied. It is also within the agent's vision range (distance 2.0). Therefore, moving to [36,13] maximizes the agent's welfare by moving to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value available."
32,153,movement,[11,34],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is lower than the sugar values of the occupied neighboring positions. Since the agent cannot move to occupied positions and the unoccupied positions have low sugar values, the agent will move to the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [11,34] and [12,35]. Choosing [11,34] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
32,148,movement,[17,38],"The agent is currently at position [20, 38] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 4, but many are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value (4.0) are at [17, 38], [17, 39], [17, 40], and [17, 41], all at distances between 3.0 and 4.24. Among these, [17, 38] is the closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 4.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 38] to maximize welfare."
32,145,movement,[35,3],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see several unoccupied positions with sugar values. The maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [35,3], [35,4], and [34,3]. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are [35,3] at distance 1.0 and [35,4] at distance 1.41. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar, which is [35,3]."
32,23,movement,[34,3],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [34, 3] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other available positions with sugar values of 2.0 or less. Therefore, the agent should move to [34, 3]."
32,37,movement,[36,6],"The agent is currently at position [36,5] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0 to 3.61. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [36,6]. Moving to [36,6] yields maximum welfare and is the closest such position."

Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [17, 39], [15, 38], [17, 40], and [16, 41]. All these positions have the same sugar value, so the agent should move to the nearest one. The closest position with sugar 4.0 is [17, 39] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent will move to [17, 39]."
32,58,movement,[28,11],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [28,11] and [29,12] have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied.

32,8,movement,[32,10],"All visible positions with higher sugar values (3.0) are occupied by other agents. The only unoccupied positions have sugar values of 2.0 or less. Among these, the nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0 to 2.24. Moving to any of these will increase welfare compared to the current position with sugar value 1.0. Choosing the closest unoccupied position with sugar 2.0 at [32,10]."
32,135,movement,[32,5],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision, the position [32,5] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is within vision distance (1.41). Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other available positions with sugar values of 2.0 or less."

25,102,movement,[12,42],"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0. Since all these positions are unoccupied and have equal sugar, moving to any of these closest positions maximizes welfare. Choosing position [12,42] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
25,74,movement,[28,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [28, 2] and [27, 3] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since both are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, moving to [28, 2] is chosen arbitrarily as it is to the right, which is a natural preference for movement."
25,56,movement,[37,10],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available in the visible area. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0: (37,10) and (36,12). Both are equally good in terms of sugar and distance. Choosing (37,10) as it is directly adjacent and slightly more central."
25,114,movement,[31,7],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 3.0 at multiple positions: [31,7], [32,8], [34,8], [32,9], and [33,9]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [31,7] and [32,8] at distances 1.41 and 2.0 respectively. The agent chooses to move to [31,7] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value, optimizing its welfare."
25,71,movement,[19,35],"The agent is currently at position [19, 34] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [19, 35], [20, 35], [20, 36], [21, 36], [19, 37], [18, 37], and [20, 37], all with sugar value 3. Among these, the closest is [19, 35] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [19, 35] to maximize welfare."
25,71,reproduction,[2],"Agent 71 is female, age 26, with sugar 26 which is above the minimum required 15 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 2, who is male, age 26, with sugar 56. Both have empty neighboring sites (agent 71 has [19,34],[20,35] and agent 2 has [18,36],[20,36],[19,37]). Since agent 71 can reproduce with up to 1 partner and all conditions are met, reproduction will occur with agent 2."
25,14,movement,[12,35],"Among the visible positions, the one at [12, 35] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. It is within vision range and closer than other positions with lower sugar values. Moving there maximizes welfare."
25,38,movement,[33,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: (33,2), (32,3), and (34,2). Choosing (33,2) as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare within vision."
25,125,movement,[12,36],"The agent is currently at position [12, 37] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0, available at multiple positions such as [12, 36], [13, 38], [14, 38], [10, 39], etc. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [12, 36] at distance 1.0, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [12, 36] to maximize welfare."
25,88,movement,[14,38],"The agent is currently at position [14, 39] with sugar value 1.0. All adjacent positions with higher sugar values (3.0) are unoccupied and within vision range. Since all these positions have the same maximum sugar value of 3.0, the agent will move to the nearest one. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [14, 38] and [15, 39]. The agent will move to [14, 38] as it is the first found with maximum welfare and nearest distance."
25,121,movement,[33,13],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [33,13] and [35,13]. Moving to either of these positions will maximize welfare by increasing sugar intake and is within vision range."
25,120,movement,[31,11],"The agent is currently at position [32, 11]. Among the visible positions, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [31, 11], [33, 11], and [32, 12]. Choosing any of these positions will maximize welfare. I choose to move to [31, 11] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
25,103,movement,[33,9],"The agent is currently at position [33,10] with sugar 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [33,9], [33,11], [32,9], [34,9], [33,12], [32,8], [34,8], [32,12], [31,12], [36,9], [30,12], [36,12], [31,13], [35,13], [33,14], [32,14], [30,13], [37,8], [29,12], [31,14], [35,14], [33,15], [32,15], [34,15], [33,16]. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1 or 1.41. The agent will move to the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value, which is [33,9] (distance 1.0, sugar 3.0)."
25,133,movement,[9,37],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Among these positions, the closest ones with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 (positions [9,37]) and 1.41 (positions [9,36], [9,38]). The nearest position with maximum sugar is [9,37]. Therefore, the agent moves to position [9,37] to maximize its welfare."
25,17,movement,[10,30],"Among the visible positions within vision range, positions [10,30], [12,30], and [11,31] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar value and distance, moving to any of these maximizes welfare. Choosing [10,30] arbitrarily among the best options."
25,90,movement,[18,38],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with lower values. The agent's vision is 6, and it should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value that is unoccupied. The closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.41: [18,38], [16,40], and [18,40]. Among these, [18,38] is the closest and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [18,38]."
25,129,movement,[28,11],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at positions [28,11], [29,9], [28,12], [29,12], [30,12], and [29,13]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [28,11] and [29,9], both at distance 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The agent chooses to move to [28,11] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value and is unoccupied."
25,131,movement,[15,33],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0. Among these, moving to position [15,33] is chosen arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare."

Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [36,12], [35,13], and [37,13]. All these positions are unoccupied. Choosing [36,12] as it is directly adjacent and has maximum sugar value within vision."
25,101,movement,[37,7],"The agent is currently at position [36,7] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values mostly 3 or 2. The maximum sugar value among visible unoccupied positions is 3. The nearest positions with sugar value 3 are [37,7] and [37,8], both at distance 1 or 1.41. Choosing the closest one, [37,7], to maximize welfare and minimize movement cost."
25,106,movement,[15,38],"The agent is currently at position [15, 37] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 2, with no higher values available. Among these, the positions with sugar value 3 are at distances 1 to 6, but many of the closest high sugar positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value is [15, 38] with sugar value 3 and distance 1. Moving there maximizes welfare and is the closest such position."
25,40,movement,[12,41],"The agent is currently at position [13, 40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. The closest such positions are [12, 41] at distance 1.41 and [13, 38] at distance 2.0. The nearest is [12, 41], which is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value visible. Therefore, the agent will move to [12, 41]."

9,80,movement,[34,12],"The agent is currently at position [35,11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.41 to 3.61. The closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [34,12] and [36,12] at distance 1.41. Both are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value available. The agent will move to [34,12] (or [36,12]) to maximize welfare and minimize distance. Choosing [34,12] arbitrarily among the closest options."
9,42,movement,[25,7],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [25,7], [24,8], [25,6], [25,8], [26,7], and [24,9] all have the highest sugar value of 2.0. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value (2.0) are at distance 1.0: [25,7] and [24,8]. Choosing [25,7] as the target position to move to, as it is the first found with maximum welfare and nearest distance."
9,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since no position offers better welfare, the agent will not move."
9,88,movement,[14,42],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [14,42], [13,43], and [14,44]. Since [14,42] is unoccupied and closest, the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
9,58,movement,[32,6],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. All unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0. The agent chooses the nearest position with the maximum sugar value, which is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [32,6], [31,7], and [33,7]. The agent selects [32,6] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare."
9,63,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position also has zero sugar. Since no position offers better welfare, the agent will not move."
9,84,movement,[32,12],"The agent is currently at position [33, 11] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions within a distance of 5. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [32, 12] at distance 1.41, [31, 11] at distance 2.0, and [33, 13] at distance 2.0. The closest position with maximum sugar is [32, 12]. Therefore, the agent should move to [32, 12] to maximize welfare."
9,19,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher welfare (sugar value) to move to, the agent will stay in place."
9,65,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have the same sugar value of 1.0. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare equal to the neighbors, the agent will not move."
9,59,movement,[16,36],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. The position [16,36] is unoccupied and at distance 1.0, so it is chosen for movement to maximize welfare and minimize travel distance."
9,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Moving to any other position does not increase welfare."
9,82,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position also has zero sugar. Since there is no better position to move to in terms of sugar welfare, the agent will not move."
9,37,movement,[37,7],"The agent is currently at position [37,8] with sugar value 1. The visible positions all have sugar values of 3 or less, with many positions having sugar value 3 at distance 1 or 1.41. Among these, positions [37,7] and [38,8] are at distance 1 and have sugar value 3, which is the maximum welfare available in the visible positions. Both positions are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum welfare, choosing [37,7] as it is directly adjacent and has the maximum sugar value of 3."
9,20,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
9,97,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
10,46,movement,[14,37],"The agent is currently at position [17,35] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 6. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 4.0, found at positions [14,37], [15,38], [16,39], and [15,39]. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest among these is at distance 3.61. Therefore, the agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [14,37]."
10,30,movement,[11,40],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0 is at [11,40] with distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [11,40] to maximize welfare."
10,59,movement,[15,38],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [15,38], [16,39], and [15,39], all at distances between 2.24 and 3.16. Among these, [15,38] is the closest with sugar 4.0 and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent moves to [15,38]."
10,71,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is equal to the current position's sugar value. Since the agent is already on a position with maximum welfare (sugar value 1.0) and no other position offers higher sugar, the agent will not move."
10,3,movement,[34,5],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the positions [34,5], [36,5], and [35,6] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Since all have equal sugar value and are at the same distance, moving to any of these positions would maximize welfare. Choosing to move to [34,5] arbitrarily among the best options."

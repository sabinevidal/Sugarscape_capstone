14,14,movement,[17,33],"Among the visible positions, several have the maximum sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [17,33] and [16,34]. Both are unoccupied and equally good in terms of welfare and distance. Choosing to move to [17,33] arbitrarily as it is one of the closest maximum welfare positions."
14,85,movement,[37,9],"The agent is currently at position [35,7] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions within vision have sugar values mostly 3 or 4, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value is [37,9] with sugar value 4 and distance approximately 2.83. Moving there maximizes welfare within the agent's vision and is unoccupied."
14,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. There is no benefit in moving to any other position as they do not provide higher welfare."
14,2,movement,[15,40],"The agent is currently at position [17, 39] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4, located at positions [15, 40], [18, 41], [15, 41], and [14, 41]. Among these, [15, 40] and [15, 41] are closer (distance 2.24) compared to [18, 41] and [14, 41] (distance 2.24 and 3.61 respectively). Since [15, 40] is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value within the agent's vision, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
14,29,movement,[37,11],"The agent is currently at position [37,10] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 5, and it can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar values up to 4. The nearest positions with the maximum sugar value of 4 are [37,11], [36,11], and [36,12]. Among these, [37,11] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [37,11] to maximize its welfare."
14,56,movement,[36,12],"The agent is currently at position [35,14] with sugar 15. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4.0 at positions [36,12] and [36,11], both unoccupied. Among these, [36,12] is closer (distance 2.24) than [36,11] (distance 3.16). Therefore, the agent will move to [36,12] to maximize welfare."
14,7,movement,[13,34],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [13,34] and [12,35] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to [13,34] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare."
14,72,movement,[36,11],"The agent is currently at position [34,10] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [36,11] with sugar 4, which is unoccupied and within vision range. It is the nearest position with maximum welfare compared to other visible positions. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,11]."
14,67,movement,[14,41],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the position [14, 41] has the highest sugar value of 4.0, which is greater than the sugar at its current position (1.0). This position is also unoccupied and within vision range, so moving there maximizes the agent's welfare."
14,24,movement,[15,41],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the position [15, 41] has the highest sugar value of 4.0, which is greater than the sugar at its current position (1.0). This position is also unoccupied and within vision range, so moving there maximizes the agent's welfare."
14,12,movement,[35,6],"The agent is currently at position [34,6]. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0 to 3.61. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are [35,6], [33,5], and [33,7] at distances 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. Since all these positions have the same sugar value, the agent will move to the nearest one, which is [35,6]."
14,13,movement,[18,41],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at position [18, 41], which is at a distance of 2.83. No other unoccupied position has higher sugar value. Therefore, the agent moves to [18, 41]."
14,95,movement,[39,9],"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0. I will choose to move to one of these nearest positions with maximum sugar value, for example [39,9]."
14,100,movement,[19,38],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [19,38] and [20,39]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing to move to [19,38] as it is directly adjacent and provides maximum welfare."
14,27,movement,[27,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [27,2], [29,2], and [28,3] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions would maximize welfare. Choosing [27,2] arbitrarily as the target position."
14,11,movement,[34,4],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the positions [34,4], [33,5], and [35,4] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0. All are at a distance of 1.0 or 1.41, but [34,4] and [33,5] are closer (distance 1.0). Choosing [34,4] as it is directly adjacent and has maximum sugar value, allowing the agent to maximize welfare."
14,90,movement,[10,41],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, such as (10,41) and (11,42). Both are unoccupied and equally close. Choosing (10,41) as the move target to maximize welfare."
14,80,movement,[32,8],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Among these, position [32,8] is unoccupied and closest with sugar 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare."
14,23,movement,[37,3],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same maximum sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0. Among these, any can be chosen. I choose to move to position [37,3] which is directly above the current position and unoccupied."
14,42,movement,[26,5],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [26,5], [25,6], [26,4], [26,6], [27,5], and [25,7] all have the maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [26,5] and [25,6]. Choosing [26,5] as it is the first found with max sugar at minimum distance."
14,26,movement,[40,6],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The closest position with maximum sugar is at [40,6] with distance 1.0 and sugar 3.0, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
14,60,movement,[33,7],"The agent is currently at position [33,9] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 2.0, such as [33,7], [31,9], and [35,9]. Among these, [33,7] is the closest and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,7] to maximize welfare."
14,88,movement,[11,39],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1. To maximize welfare, the agent should move to the nearest unoccupied position with sugar value 3. The closest such positions are at distance 1, for example [11,39] or [10,40]. Choosing [11,39] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
14,59,movement,[16,41],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or less, and all positions with sugar 3.0 are at a distance of approximately 1.41 to 5.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.41: (16,41), (14,43), and (16,43). Among these, (16,41) is chosen as it is closest and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare by collecting the highest available sugar nearby."
14,75,movement,[30,1],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [30,1], [32,1], and [31,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. All are at distance 1, so the agent can move to any of these to maximize welfare. Choosing [30,1] arbitrarily among these equally optimal options."
14,84,movement,[31,11],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [31,11] and [32,12]. Choosing [31,11] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."

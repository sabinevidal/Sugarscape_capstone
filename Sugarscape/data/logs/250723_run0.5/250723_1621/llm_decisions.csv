6,55,movement,[30,7],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3 or less, but the maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3 are at distance 1.0 (positions [30,7] and [31,8]). Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar, I select position [30,7]."
6,66,movement,[36,6],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are not occupied. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The agent chooses to move to position [36,6], which is unoccupied, has sugar 3.0, and is the nearest position with maximum welfare."
6,60,movement,[34,10],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Among these positions, the closest ones with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 (positions [34,10] and [34,11]). The agent chooses to move to [34,10] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) and is unoccupied."
6,43,movement,[40,7],"The agent is currently at position [41,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. Several positions have sugar value 3.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [41,6] and [40,7]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [40,7] as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar value."
6,29,movement,[36,12],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0: [36,12]. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare, so the agent should move there."
7,80,movement,[34,11],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are not occupied. The highest sugar value available is 4.0, found at multiple positions. Among these, the closest position with sugar 4.0 is at [34,11] with a distance of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare while being the nearest such position."
7,40,movement,[18,41],"The agent is currently at position [19, 43] with sugar 18. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4.0 at positions [18, 41], [17, 41], [16, 43], [16, 42], and [16, 41]. Among these, [18, 41] is the closest (distance 2.24) and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while being the nearest maximum sugar position available."
7,90,movement,[14,39],"The agent is currently at position [17, 36] with sugar 21. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4.0 at positions [14, 39], [15, 40], [17, 41], and [16, 41]. Among these, [14, 39] is the closest with a distance of 4.24 and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 39] to maximize welfare."
7,8,movement,[36,11],"The agent is currently at position [34, 12] with sugar value 1. There are multiple visible unoccupied positions within vision range, with the highest sugar value being 4 at positions [36, 11] and [36, 13], both at a distance of 2.24. Moving to either of these positions will maximize the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake. The agent will move to [36, 11] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar value available."
7,63,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, and the only occupied position nearby is at [39,30], the agent should not move."
7,39,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
7,27,movement,[31,1],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [31,1], [33,1], and [32,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally good in terms of sugar and distance (distance 1), moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [31,1] arbitrarily among these options."
7,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. There is no unoccupied position with higher sugar value to move to."
7,93,movement,[31,4],"The agent has a vision of 4 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at various distances. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The position [31,4] is at distance 1.0 and unoccupied, so it is the nearest position with maximum welfare. Therefore, the agent should move to [31,4]."
7,79,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have zero sugar value, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying in place conserves energy and avoids unnecessary movement."
7,69,movement,[20,43],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The position [20,43] has sugar 3.0 and is at distance 1.0, which is the nearest position with maximum welfare. The position [21,42] is occupied, so it cannot be chosen. Therefore, the agent should move to [20,43]."
7,37,movement,[37,9],"The agent is currently at position [38,9] with sugar value 1. The nearest unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value (4) are [37,9], [36,8], [36,7], [35,9], and [35,8]. Among these, [37,9] is the closest at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,9] to maximize welfare."
7,97,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
7,65,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0. Since the current position is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value, there is no benefit in moving."
7,87,movement,[21,41],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [21, 41] and [22, 42] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to [21, 41] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare."
7,29,movement,[36,13],"The agent is currently at position [36, 12] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with the highest sugar value of 4.0 that are unoccupied are [36, 13], [35, 9], [36, 8], [35, 8], and [36, 7]. Among these, [36, 13] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [36, 13] to maximize welfare."
7,67,movement,[12,35],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0: [12,35] and [11,36]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [12,35] as it is directly adjacent and provides maximum welfare."
7,72,movement,[35,9],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar values. The maximum sugar value visible in unoccupied positions is 4. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 4 are at distances 2.83 ([35,9]) and 3.16 ([36,8]). The agent chooses the closest position with maximum sugar value, which is [35,9]."
7,74,movement,[35,1],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [35,1], [37,1], and [36,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. All are at distance 1.0, so the agent can move to any of these to maximize welfare. Choosing position [35,1] arbitrarily among these options."

0,1,movement,[3,5],"The agent has a vision of 2 and sees two positions with sugar values greater than 0: [3,5] with sugar 10 and [1,3] with sugar 8. Both are at distance 2. The agent chooses the position with the maximum sugar value, which is [3,5]. This position is unoccupied, so the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
0,1,movement,[5,4],"The agent is currently at position [4,4] with 0 sugar. Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [5,4] and [1,4] have the highest sugar value of 9. Both are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [5,4] at distance 1.0, which is closer than [1,4] at distance 3.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [5,4] to maximize welfare."
0,1,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range are either occupied or have zero sugar value. The agent is currently on position [3,3] with sugar value 0.0 and no unoccupied neighboring positions with higher sugar value are available. Therefore, the agent should not move."
0,1,movement,[2,2],"The agent can see two positions with sugar: [2,2] with 15 sugar and [4,4] with 12 sugar. Both are unoccupied. The agent's vision is 2, so both positions are reachable. The position [2,2] has the highest sugar value and is at a distance of 1.41, which is the same as [4,4]. Therefore, the agent moves to [2,2] to maximize welfare."
0,2,movement,[4,4],"The agent is currently at position [5,5] with 0 sugar value. Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [4,4] has the highest sugar value of 12.0 and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [4,4] to maximize welfare."
0,3,movement,[1,1],"The agent can see a position at [1,1] with the highest sugar value of 10.0 within its vision range. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare compared to other visible positions. Therefore, the agent should move there."

12,54,movement,[16,42],"The agent is currently at position [16, 43] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [16, 42], [17, 42], and [13, 42], each with sugar value 4. Among these, [16, 42] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 42] to maximize welfare."
12,7,movement,[11,34],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [11,34], [10,35], and [11,36] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar value and distance, moving to any of these maximizes welfare. Choosing [11,34] arbitrarily among the best options."
12,57,movement,[13,42],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are not occupied. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at position [13, 42]. This position is unoccupied and within vision range. Therefore, the agent moves to [13, 42] to maximize its welfare."
12,3,movement,[32,5],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [32, 5] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to the current position and other visible positions."
12,69,movement,[20,38],"The agent is currently at position [20, 39] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. Positions with sugar 3.0 are [20, 38], [21, 39], [19, 40], [21, 40], [20, 37], [22, 39], and [20, 41]. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [20, 38] and [21, 39]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [20, 38]."
12,93,movement,[29,7],"The agent is currently at position [29,6] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 2, with none higher than 3. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value of 3 that is unoccupied. Among the positions with sugar 3, [29,7] is at distance 1 and unoccupied, making it the optimal move."
12,85,movement,[35,7],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 4.0. Among these positions, the closest ones with sugar value 4.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The agent chooses to move to position [35,7], which is at distance 1.0 and has sugar value 4.0, maximizing welfare while minimizing movement distance."
12,23,movement,[36,5],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same maximum sugar value of 3.0. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value to maximize welfare, position [36,5] at distance 1.0 is selected."
12,8,movement,[33,12],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [33,12], [35,13], and [33,11]. Among these, [33,12] is the closest at a distance of 2.0. Both [35,13] and [33,11] are also at similar distances but [33,12] is chosen as it is the closest with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
12,49,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent should stay in place."
12,59,movement,[17,42],"The agent is currently at position [16, 38] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with higher sugar values are mostly occupied. The highest sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 4 at [17, 42], which is within vision range and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare as it provides the highest sugar value reachable."
12,100,movement,[19,40],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, for example [19,40]. Moving to any of these positions will maximize welfare. Choosing [19,40] as it is the closest with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
12,70,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
12,81,movement,[31,5],"The agent is currently at position [30,5] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision have sugar values mostly 2 or 3, with the maximum sugar value of 3 at multiple positions. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are [31,5] at distance 1, [30,7] at distance 2, and [32,6] at distance 2.24. The position [31,5] is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar value 3. Therefore, the agent should move to [31,5]."
12,14,movement,[15,33],"Among the visible positions, those with the highest sugar value (3.0) are at positions [15,33], [14,34], [13,34], [15,34], [16,33], and [14,35]. All these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [15,33] and [14,34]. Choosing [15,33] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
12,29,movement,[35,11],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are not occupied. The maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 4.0 are at distance 1.0: [35,11] and [35,13]. The agent chooses to move to [35,11] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (sugar)."

30,30,movement,[12,30],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [12,30] as it is unoccupied, has maximum welfare (sugar value 2.0), and is nearest."
30,113,movement,[31,1],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see the positions [31,1] with sugar 2.0 and [30,1] (current position) with sugar 1.0. The positions [29,1] and [30,2] are occupied. The best unoccupied position within vision is [31,1] with sugar 2.0, which is better than the current position's sugar. Therefore, the agent should move to [31,1]."
30,128,movement,[31,7],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 2.0. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [31,7] and [30,8], both at distance 1.0. Choosing [31,7] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare at minimum distance."
30,109,movement,[40,8],"The agent is currently at position [41,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances ranging from 1.0 to 4.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [40,8] and [42,8]. Both are unoccupied and have the highest sugar value available. The agent will move to one of these nearest positions with maximum sugar value to maximize welfare. Choosing [40,8] as the target position."
30,129,movement,[29,13],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are not occupied. All unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.41 (position [29,13]) and distance 2.0 (positions [30,12], [32,14]). The closest position with maximum sugar is [29,13]. Therefore, the agent moves to [29,13]."
30,142,movement,[32,6],"The agent is currently at position [33,8] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but the closest among them is at position [32,6] with a distance of 2.24. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while being the nearest such position."
30,96,movement,[9,39],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. All positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The agent chooses the nearest position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [9,39], [10,40], and [9,41]. The agent selects [9,39] as it is the closest and unoccupied."
30,46,movement,[13,36],"The agent is currently at position [13, 37] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances 1.0 to 3.61. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [13, 36], [12, 36], and [14, 36], all at distance 1.0 to 1.41. Since all these positions are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value visible, the agent will move to the nearest one, which is [13, 36]."
30,134,movement,[31,6],"The agent is currently at position [32,5] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at position [31,6], which is within vision range and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare by moving to the position with the highest sugar value nearby."
30,11,movement,[32,2],"The agent is currently at position [33, 2] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision are [32, 2], [34, 2], and [33, 3], each with sugar value 2.0, which is higher than the current position. All these positions are at distance 1.0. Since all have equal maximum welfare (sugar value), the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [32, 2] as it is the first in the list of visible positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
30,137,movement,[12,36],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. Among the positions with sugar value 3.0, the closest ones are at distance 1.41: [12,36] and [14,36]. Both are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value visible. The agent chooses to move to [12,36] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
30,120,movement,[28,12],"The agent is currently at position [29,12] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0 at multiple positions such as [28,12], [30,12], [30,11], [31,10], [32,12], [32,11], [32,14], [30,8], [32,15], [33,14], [31,16], and [34,12]. Among these, the closest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0 is [28,12] or [30,12], both at distance 1.0. Since both are equally good, the agent can move to either. Choosing [28,12] as it is the first found with max sugar and closest distance. This move maximizes welfare by moving to the highest sugar value position within vision and is unoccupied."
30,50,movement,[15,43],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [15,43] and [17,43]. Choosing to move to [15,43] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and closest distance."
30,112,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is low compared to neighbors' sugar levels. The agent is currently at position [16,37] with sugar 30.5. Moving to any visible position would not increase welfare significantly, and all positions with higher sugar are occupied. Therefore, the agent should not move."
30,66,movement,[36,7],"The agent is currently at position [36,6] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values are [36,7] with 3.0 sugar and [38,6] with 3.0 sugar. Both positions are unoccupied and within vision range. Among these, [36,7] is closer (distance 1.0) compared to [38,6] (distance 2.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [36,7] to maximize welfare by moving to the nearest position with maximum sugar value."
30,66,reproduction,[85],"Agent 66 is female, age 31, with sugar 43.0 which is above the minimum required 22.0 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 85, who is male, age 31, with sugar 7.0. Both have empty neighboring positions (agent 66 has [36,6],[37,7] and agent 85 has [37,8],[36,9]), satisfying the condition for reproduction. Since max_partners is 1, agent 85 is selected as the partner for reproduction."
30,106,movement,[10,40],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. However, the current position is occupied by the agent itself, and the agent can move to an unoccupied position with sugar value 3.0. Among these, the nearest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The agent chooses to move to position [10,40], which is unoccupied, has sugar value 3.0, and is the nearest position with maximum welfare."
30,81,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is lower than the agent's current sugar level of 57.0. Moving to any of these positions does not provide a welfare improvement. Therefore, the agent should not move."
30,107,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 1 and can only see its current position and a distant position with no sugar. The current position has a sugar value of 1.0 and is occupied by the agent itself. All adjacent positions within vision are occupied by other agents. Therefore, there is no unoccupied position within vision that produces higher welfare. The agent should not move."

33,59,movement,[10,36],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range for maximum sugar value. The highest sugar value available in an unoccupied position is 3.0, found at positions [10,36] and [12,36]. Among these, [10,36] is closer (distance 1.0) compared to [12,36] (distance 2.24). Therefore, the agent moves to [10,36] to maximize welfare."
34,109,movement,[40,6],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, the agent selects position [40,6] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
34,42,movement,[28,1],"The agent can move to positions [28,1] or [30,1], both unoccupied and with the highest sugar value of 2.0 within its vision range. Both positions are at distance 1, so either is optimal. The agent chooses to move to [28,1]."
34,132,movement,[33,7],"Among the unoccupied visible positions, the positions [33,7] and [32,8] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are at distances 1.41 and 2.0 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [33,7]. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,7]."
34,104,movement,[15,42],"The agent is currently at position [18, 42]. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [15, 42] and [13, 42]. Both are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [15, 42] at distance 3.0, which is closer than [13, 42] at distance 5.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 42] to maximize welfare."
34,75,movement,[27,2],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see three unoccupied positions: [27,2] with sugar 2.0, [26,1] with sugar 1.0, and its current position [27,1] with sugar 1.0. The position [27,2] has the highest sugar value among unoccupied positions within vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [27,2] to maximize welfare."
34,75,reproduction,[74],"Agent 75 is female, age 35, with sugar 17.0 which meets the minimum sugar required for reproduction. The only eligible partner is agent 74, a male aged 34 with sugar 33.0. Although agent 74 has no empty nearby positions, agent 75 has three empty neighboring sites, satisfying the condition that at least one of the pair has an empty adjacent site. Since max_partners is 1, agent 74 is selected as the reproduction partner."
34,93,movement,[31,4],"The agent is currently at position [31,3] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values ranging from 2.0 to 3.0. The highest sugar value among unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [31,4] and [33,3]. Both are at distances 1.0 and 2.0 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [31,4]. Therefore, the agent should move to [31,4]."
34,113,movement,[29,3],"The agent can see three positions within its vision: its current position (29,2) with sugar 1.0, (29,3) with sugar 2.0, and (29,1) with sugar 1.0. Both (28,2) and (30,2) are occupied and thus unavailable. Among the unoccupied positions, (29,3) has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is at distance 1, so moving there maximizes welfare."
34,150,movement,[36,5],"The agent is currently at position [37,5] with sugar value 1. All visible unoccupied positions have sugar value 3 or 2, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are [36,5] and [38,4], both at distance 1 or slightly more. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [36,5]."
34,123,movement,[30,1],"Among the unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [30,1], [32,1], and [31,2] all have the maximum sugar value of 2.0. Since all have equal welfare and are at the same distance, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [30,1] arbitrarily."
34,108,movement,[35,8],"The agent is currently at position [36,7] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [35,8] and [35,9], both with sugar value 4. Among these, [35,8] is closer (distance 1.41) than [35,9] (distance 2.24). Therefore, the agent should move to [35,8] to maximize welfare."
34,114,movement,[35,5],"The agent is currently at position [33,6] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [35,5], [32,8], [33,3], and [33,9], each with sugar value 3. Among these, [35,5] and [32,8] are closest at distance 2.24. Choosing [35,5] as it is within vision and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare at the nearest distance."
34,37,movement,[35,9],"The agent is currently at position [36,10] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are at [35,9] and [33,11], both with sugar value 4. Among these, [35,9] is closer (distance 1.41) compared to [33,11] (distance 3.16). Therefore, the agent should move to [35,9] to maximize welfare."
34,88,movement,[13,34],"The agent is currently at position [12, 34] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [13, 34], [13, 33], and [11, 35], all at a distance of 1.0 or 1.41. Since these positions are unoccupied and provide maximum welfare within vision, the agent should move to one of these. Choosing [13, 34] as it is the closest and directly adjacent."
34,120,movement,[33,11],"The agent is currently at position [35,11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [33,11] has the highest sugar value of 4.0. It is also within the agent's vision and unoccupied. Therefore, moving to [33,11] maximizes the agent's welfare by moving to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value."
34,138,movement,[14,39],"The agent is currently at position [13, 39] with sugar 24.0. Among visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [14, 39] and [13, 42]. Both are unoccupied and at distances 1.0 and 3.0 respectively. The nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar) is [14, 39]. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 39]."
34,115,movement,[31,15],"The agent is currently at position [32, 15] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0, available at multiple positions such as [31, 15], [32, 16], [31, 16], [33, 16], and others. All these positions are unoccupied and at a distance of 1.0 or 1.41, which is within the agent's vision of 6. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is any of the positions with sugar 3.0 at distance 1.0. Choosing [31, 15] as it is the closest and unoccupied."
34,46,movement,[13,42],"The agent is currently at position [15, 39] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are at [13, 42] with sugar 4.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision range. It is unoccupied and reachable. Therefore, the agent should move to [13, 42] to maximize sugar intake."
34,107,movement,[31,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, positions [31, 2] and [30, 3] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since both are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, moving to [31, 2] is chosen arbitrarily as it is to the right, which might be a natural preference."
34,142,movement,[29,8],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. However, since the agent's current position has a sugar value of 1.0, moving to any position with sugar value 3.0 would increase welfare. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.41 (positions [29,8] and [29,10]). Choosing the closest one, [29,8], to maximize welfare and minimize movement distance."

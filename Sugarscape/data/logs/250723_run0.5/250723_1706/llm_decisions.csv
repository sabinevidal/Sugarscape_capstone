21,38,movement,[35,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [35,3] and [34,4] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are unoccupied and at a distance of 1.0. Choosing [35,3] as it is directly north and equally beneficial."
21,38,reproduction,[23],"Agent 38 is female, age 22, with sugar 52.5 which is above the minimum required 17.0 for reproduction. The only eligible partner is agent 23, a male aged 22 with sugar 67.0. Both have empty neighboring positions (agent 38 has three empty spots and agent 23 has two), satisfying the reproduction conditions. Since max_partners is 2 but only one eligible partner exists, agent 23 is chosen for reproduction."
21,123,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0. The agent is currently at position [31,2] which already has this maximum sugar value and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent will not move as it is already at a position with maximum welfare."
21,17,movement,[10,30],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [10, 30], [12, 30], and [11, 31] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [10, 30] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value."
21,8,movement,[33,8],"The agent is currently at position [33,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [33,8], [31,11], [33,6], [33,5], [29,9], [37,9], and [33,13]. However, positions [31,11] and [33,6] are occupied. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar (3.0) is [33,8] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,8] to maximize welfare."
21,109,movement,[39,14],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0, and there are multiple such positions at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [40,13] and [39,14]. The agent chooses to move to [39,14] as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare at the nearest distance."
21,95,movement,[40,7],"The agent is currently at position [40,8] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied or out of reach. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [40,7], [41,8], [41,7], and [39,9], all at distance 1 or 1.41. Among these, [40,7] is the closest and unoccupied, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
21,93,movement,[30,6],"The agent's vision is 4, and it can see several positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [30,6], [30,5], and [30,7]. All these positions are at distances 1.0 or 1.41, which are closer than other positions with lower sugar values. Among these, [30,6] is the closest with sugar 3.0 and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [30,6] to maximize welfare."
21,96,movement,[10,36],"The agent is currently at position [11,37] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0, but all these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distances 1.41 to 2.24. The nearest position with sugar 3.0 is [10,36] at distance 1.41, which is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while minimizing movement distance."
21,96,reproduction,[59],"Agent 96 is female, age 22, with sugar 22.5 which is above the minimum required 13.0 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 59, who is male, age 22, with sugar 16.0. Both have empty neighboring positions available (agent 96 has [10,35] and [9,36], agent 59 has [12,36] and [11,37]). Since the partner is within vision range and meets all criteria, and both have empty adjacent sites, reproduction is possible and beneficial to continue the population. Therefore, agent 96 should reproduce with partner 59."
21,116,movement,[10,40],"The agent is currently at position [11, 40] with sugar value 1.0. All adjacent positions with higher sugar values (e.g., [10, 39] with 29.0, [10, 37] with 49.0, [2, 13, 36] with 55.0) are occupied. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41, such as [10, 40] and [10, 41]. The agent will move to the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0, which is [10, 40]."
21,114,movement,[33,6],"The agent is currently at position [35,7] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values are at [33,6], [37,8], [33,5], [37,9], and [38,7], all with sugar value 3.0. Among these, [33,6] and [37,8] are at distance 2.24, which is the shortest distance to the maximum sugar value available. Both positions are unoccupied. Choosing [33,6] as the target position to move to, as it is within vision and unoccupied, and provides maximum welfare (highest sugar value) at the nearest distance."
21,117,movement,[37,9],"The agent is currently at position [38,10] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distances approximately 1.41 to 3.61. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [37,9] and [39,9] at distance 1.41. Choosing [37,9] as the target position to move to maximize welfare while minimizing distance."
21,13,movement,[17,36],"The agent is currently at position [16, 36] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [17, 36], which is at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 36] to maximize its welfare."
21,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
21,111,movement,[37,4],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [37,4], [38,4], and [38,6]. Among these, [37,4] is the closest and has maximum sugar value. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,4]."
21,108,movement,[36,11],"The agent is currently at position [34,11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at multiple positions such as [36,11], [36,12], [33,13], [32,13], [31,11], [34,14], [31,12], [33,14], [35,14], etc. The nearest of these is at distance 2.0, for example [36,11]. Moving to [36,11] will maximize the agent's welfare by moving to the highest sugar value position within vision and is unoccupied."
21,66,movement,[38,7],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are unoccupied. The highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at positions [38,7], [40,6], [41,6], and [37,8]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 2.0 ([38,7]) and 2.24 ([40,6], [41,6], [37,8]). The agent chooses to move to [38,7] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar) and is unoccupied."

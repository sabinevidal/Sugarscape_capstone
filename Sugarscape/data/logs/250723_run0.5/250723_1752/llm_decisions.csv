32,101,movement,[33,14],"The agent is currently at position [33,12] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 2.0: [35,12] and [33,14]. Both are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value available within vision. Choosing the closest one, [33,14], which is directly south and at distance 2.0, the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
32,104,movement,[17,41],"The agent is currently at position [15, 41] with sugar value 1. The nearest unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value within vision are at distance 2.0 with sugar value 4.0 at positions [17, 41], [17, 40], and [17, 42]. Among these, all are unoccupied and equally distant. Choosing the first found position [17, 41] to maximize welfare and minimize distance."
32,146,movement,[29,3],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see three positions: its current position (28,3) with sugar 1.0, and two adjacent unoccupied positions (29,3) and (28,4) each with sugar 2.0. Both unoccupied positions have the same sugar value, which is higher than the current position. The agent will move to one of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing (29,3) arbitrarily as it is equally beneficial."
32,117,movement,[37,10],"The agent is currently at position [37, 11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [37, 10]. This position is unoccupied and provides the maximum welfare within the agent's vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [37, 10]."
32,75,movement,[28,1],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [28,1], [27,2], and [29,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. All are at distance 1.0, so the agent can move to any of these to maximize welfare. Choosing [28,1] arbitrarily as the target position."
32,5,movement,[17,40],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [17,40] and [17,42]. Both are at the same distance (3.16) from the agent's current position. The agent chooses to move to [17,40] as it is the first encountered position with maximum sugar value and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing its sugar intake."
32,40,movement,[10,42],"The agent is currently at position [10, 43] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except a few with 2.0. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. The closest such positions are at distance 1.0: [10, 42], [9, 43], and [10, 44]. Any of these positions are equally good in terms of sugar value and distance. Choosing [10, 42] as the target position for movement."
32,67,movement,[8,40],"The agent is currently at position [8, 41] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41, specifically positions [8, 40], [8, 42], [9, 40], and [9, 42]. All these positions are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [8, 40] or [8, 42]. Choosing [8, 40] as it is directly above and at distance 1.0."
32,126,movement,[9,38],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple positions with sugar values of 3.0 within its vision range. All these positions are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value available in the visible area. Among these, the closest position with sugar 3.0 is at [9,38] with a distance of 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [9,38] to maximize its welfare by collecting the highest sugar nearby."
32,142,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [31,5] with sugar 28.5. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values mostly 3.0 or 2.0, which are lower than the current sugar level. Moving to any of these positions would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."
32,131,movement,[15,33],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the positions [15,33] and [17,34] have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are at distances 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The nearest position with maximum welfare is [15,33] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [15,33]."
32,42,movement,[29,2],"The agent can move to one of the unoccupied positions within its vision range that have the highest sugar value of 2.0. These positions are [29,2], [31,2], and [30,3], all at distance 1. Since all have equal sugar and distance, the agent can choose any of these. Moving to any of these positions will maximize welfare compared to staying at the current position with sugar value 1.0."
32,154,movement,[31,8],"The agent is currently at position [30,8] with a sugar value of 2. Nearby visible positions with the highest sugar value of 3.0 are [31,8], [30,6], [29,6], [32,7], [33,8], [34,8], [34,7], [29,12], and [34,10]. Among these, the closest unoccupied position is [31,8] at distance 1.0. Since [31,8] is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value within vision, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
32,115,movement,[32,14],"The agent is currently at position [32,12] with sugar 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 within its vision range. Among these, the nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 2.0 to 2.83. The agent chooses to move to position [32,14], which is unoccupied, has sugar value 3.0, and is the closest position with maximum welfare within its vision."
32,74,movement,[27,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, positions [27,2], [26,3], and [27,4] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. All are at distance 1.0, so the agent can move to any of these to maximize welfare. Choosing [27,2] arbitrarily among these options."
32,113,movement,[30,2],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see the current position (30,1) with sugar value 1.0 and the position (30,2) with sugar value 1.0. Both positions have the same sugar value, but the current position is occupied by the agent itself, and the position (30,2) is unoccupied. Moving to (30,2) would maintain the maximum welfare (sugar value 1.0) and is unoccupied, so the agent should move there."
32,112,movement,[15,38],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at position [15, 38], which is at a distance of 2.24. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other positions with sugar values of 3.0 or less. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 38]."
32,12,movement,[29,6],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value among visible unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at positions [29,6], [30,6], [32,7], [33,8], [29,12], [34,8], and [34,7]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [29,6] and [30,6], both at a distance of 2.0 and 2.24 respectively. The agent chooses to move to [29,6] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value available within vision and unoccupied."
32,134,movement,[32,7],"The agent is currently at position [32,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [32,7], [33,8], [34,8], and [34,7]. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are [32,7] and [33,8], both at distance 1.0. Choosing [32,7] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
32,106,movement,[11,39],"The agent is currently at position [10, 39] with sugar 34.5. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41, specifically positions [11, 39], [11, 38], [9, 40], and [11, 40]. All these positions are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [11, 39] at distance 1.0."

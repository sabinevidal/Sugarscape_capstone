3,71,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is equal to the sugar value at the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare (sugar value 1.0), there is no benefit in moving."
3,96,movement,[11,41],"The agent is currently at position [12, 41] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4, but all positions with sugar 4 are occupied or out of reach. The next best sugar value is 3, and among these, the closest unoccupied position with sugar 3 is [11, 41] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [11, 41] to maximize welfare."
3,76,movement,[22,27],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 1.0 except the current position which also has 1.0. Since all positions have equal sugar value and are unoccupied, the agent will move to the nearest position with maximum welfare, which is any adjacent position with sugar value 1.0. Choosing position [22,27] as it is adjacent and unoccupied."
3,48,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Moving to any other position would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should stay in place."
3,31,movement,[15,39],"The agent is currently at position [16, 39] with sugar value 1. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0, available at multiple positions: [15, 39], [16, 41], [14, 40], [15, 41], [17, 41], [18, 41], [16, 42], [17, 42], and [16, 43]. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 4.0 is [15, 39] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 39] to maximize welfare."
3,60,movement,[36,11],"The agent is currently at position [37,11] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision are mostly sugar value 4, but many are occupied or further away. The closest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 4 are [36,11] and [36,10], both at distance 1 and 1.41 respectively. Choosing the closest one, [36,11], maximizes welfare and is unoccupied."
3,83,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
3,44,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 2, so it can only consider positions within a distance of 2. All visible positions within this range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Therefore, there is no better position to move to for increased welfare."
3,26,movement,[44,14],"Among the visible positions, all unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1. The agent can move to any of these positions. Choosing position [44,14] as it is unoccupied and has maximum sugar value within vision range."
3,91,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
3,23,movement,[34,5],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.41 and 2.0. The closest position with sugar 3.0 is at [34,5] with distance 1.41, and it is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,5] to maximize welfare."
3,37,movement,[35,9],"The agent is currently at position [34,9] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 4 or less, with the highest sugar value of 4 at multiple positions: [35,9], [35,10], [36,9], [36,8], [36,10], [35,11], [36,7], [34,12], [37,8], [35,12], [35,13]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 4 are [35,9] at distance 1.0 and [35,10] at distance 1.41. Both are unoccupied. The agent should move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [35,9]."
3,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
3,32,movement,[25,38],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is any adjacent position with sugar value 2.0 at distance 1.0. The agent selects position [25,38] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
3,33,movement,[28,2],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [28,2] and [27,3]. Choosing [28,2] as the target position to move to, as it is one of the closest and provides maximum welfare."
3,99,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
3,30,movement,[14,40],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the position [14, 40] has the highest sugar value of 4.0 and is within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake."
3,35,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 4, so it can only consider positions within a distance of 4 from its current position (31,50). All visible positions within this range have a sugar value of 0 and are unoccupied. Since there is no position within vision that offers a higher sugar value than the current position, the agent will not move."
3,82,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent will stay in place."
3,45,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position also has zero sugar. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will not move."
3,74,movement,[39,1],"The agent can move to positions [39,1] or [40,2], both have sugar value 2.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at distance 1, so either is acceptable. The agent chooses to move to [39,1]."
3,20,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Moving to any other position does not increase welfare since sugar value is zero everywhere. Therefore, the agent should not move."
3,6,movement,[24,29],"All visible positions within vision have the same sugar value of 1.0, but the current position is already occupied by the agent and has sugar value 1.0. Since moving to any other position with the same sugar value does not provide a welfare advantage and all other positions with sugar 1.0 are unoccupied, the agent should move to the nearest such position to maximize welfare. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar 1.0 are at distance 1.0, for example [24,29]."
3,22,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have a sugar value of 0.0, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying put conserves energy and avoids unnecessary movement."

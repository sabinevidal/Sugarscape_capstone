1,81,movement,[24,8],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see several positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value visible is 2.0 at positions [24,8] and [25,8]. Both positions are unoccupied. Among these, [24,8] is closer (distance 4.0) compared to [25,8] (distance 5.0). Therefore, the agent will move to [24,8] to maximize welfare."
1,70,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
1,15,movement,[29,19],"The agent has a vision of 4 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 2.0 within its vision range. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0: positions [28,18] and [29,19]. Position [28,18] is occupied by agent 28, so it is not available. Position [29,19] is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value within vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [29,19]."
1,54,movement,[9,36],"The agent is currently at position [6, 34] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3, but they are all at distances greater than 3.6 and none are occupied. The agent's vision is 6, so it can reach these positions. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are [9, 36] at distance 3.61, [10, 35] at 4.12, [9, 37] at 4.24, and [10, 36] at 4.47. The agent should move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [9, 36]."
1,17,movement,[13,43],"All adjacent positions have the same sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Moving to any of these positions will maximize welfare. Choosing to move to position [13,43] arbitrarily among the best options."
1,40,movement,[16,38],"The agent is currently at position [17, 38] with sugar value 1. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 4. These positions are at distances ranging from 1.0 to 4.12. The nearest positions with sugar value 4 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41, specifically [16, 38] and [16, 39]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [16, 38]."
1,66,movement,[38,4],"The agent is currently at position [39,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0, available at multiple positions within vision range. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [38,4] and [39,5]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [38,4] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
1,95,movement,[24,11],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar values of 3.0 at distances of 4.0 to 6.0, but these are quite far. Closer positions with sugar value 2.0 are available at distances 1.0 to 3.61, but all positions with higher sugar values (7 or more) are occupied. The agent will move to the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value it can find, which is sugar value 2.0 at distance 1.0. Among these, position [24,11] is unoccupied and closest. Therefore, the agent will move to [24,11]."
1,12,movement,[28,9],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at positions [28,9], [28,10], [28,11], [29,9], [29,8], and [29,10]. Among these, the closest is [28,9] at a distance of 4.0. Therefore, the agent will move to [28,9]."
1,77,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, and the current position is also producing 1.0 sugar. Since moving does not increase welfare and the current position is unoccupied, the agent will not move."
1,69,movement,[23,47],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions with the highest sugar value (2.0) are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. Since all these positions are unoccupied, the agent should move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. The closest such positions are [23,47] and [22,48]. Choosing [23,47] as it is directly north and equally close."
1,36,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have zero sugar value, so there is no welfare gain from moving. The agent should stay in place."
1,80,movement,[45,15],"The agent is currently on a position with sugar value 1.0. There are multiple visible positions with sugar value 2.0 within vision range that are unoccupied. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at positions [45,15] and [43,17], both at a distance of approximately 4.47. Since these positions have higher sugar value than the current position and are unoccupied, moving to one of these maximizes welfare. Choosing [45,15] as the target position."
1,8,movement,[33,17],"The agent is currently at position [33, 21] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 2 or 3. The highest sugar value visible is 3 at position [33, 17], which is 4 units away. There are no occupied positions, so the agent can move there. Moving to [33, 17] maximizes welfare as it has the highest sugar value within vision range."
1,52,movement,[29,14],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value visible is 3.0 at several positions: [29,14], [28,12], [29,13], [30,15], [30,14], and [31,15]. Among these, the closest position with sugar 3.0 is [29,14] at a distance of 4.12. All these positions are unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [29,14] to maximize welfare by collecting the highest sugar value within vision range."
1,96,movement,[8,42],"The agent should move to the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 3.0 at positions [8,42] and [9,43]. Among these, [8,42] is closer (distance 4.12) than [9,43] (distance 5.0). Therefore, the agent will move to [8,42]."
1,32,movement,[25,40],"All visible positions within vision have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [25,40] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
1,61,movement,[26,5],"The agent has a vision of 3 and sees multiple positions with sugar value 2.0 within its vision range. All these positions are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value available in the visible positions. The nearest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Among these, the position [26,5] is at distance 1.0, which is the closest and has the maximum sugar value. Therefore, the agent should move to [26,5]."
1,28,movement,[27,17],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [27,17], [28,18], [28,17], [27,16], and [29,18] all have the highest sugar value of 2.0. However, position [28,18] is occupied, so it cannot be chosen. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value are at distance 1 or 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [27,17] at distance 1. Therefore, the agent will move to [27,17]."
1,34,movement,[7,33],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [7,33] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare."

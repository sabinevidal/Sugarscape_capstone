30,84,movement,[34,5],"The agent is currently at position [34,6] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at multiple positions ([34,5], [33,6], [32,6], [33,4], [36,7], [31,6], [31,7], [37,4], [38,6], [38,5], [38,7], [33,10]). The nearest of these is at distance 1.0, positions [34,5] and [33,6]. Choosing [34,5] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare within vision range."
30,74,movement,[26,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [26,3], [27,4], and [26,5] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar value and distance, moving to any of these maximizes welfare. Choosing [26,3] arbitrarily as the target position."
30,132,movement,[33,4],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [33,4] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other available positions with lower sugar values."
30,14,movement,[12,34],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision, all have sugar values of 3.0 or less. The maximum sugar value is 3.0, available at positions [12,34], [12,36], [11,36], and [13,36]. All these positions are at distances 1.0 or 1.41, which are within vision. The nearest positions with maximum sugar are [12,34] and [12,36] at distance 1.0. Choosing [12,34] as the target position to move to maximize welfare and minimize distance."
30,116,movement,[17,36],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible range. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. The position [17,36] is unoccupied and at distance 1.0, so moving there maximizes welfare and is the nearest such position."
30,26,movement,[38,5],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the positions [38,5], [39,6], [38,6], and [40,6] all have the highest sugar value of 3.0. They are all at a distance of 1 or approximately 1.41, which is within the agent's vision of 2. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar, [38,5] or [39,6] at distance 1.0 is preferable. Selecting [38,5] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
30,114,movement,[33,10],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The agent chooses the nearest position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. Among these, position [33,10] is at distance 1.0, which is the closest with maximum sugar value. Therefore, the agent moves to [33,10]."
30,130,movement,[19,40],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, for example [19,40]. Moving to [19,40] maximizes welfare and is the closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar."
30,105,movement,[16,35],"The agent is currently at position [17, 35] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. The closest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are [16, 35], [16, 34], and [16, 36]. Choosing the closest one, [16, 35], which is at distance 1.0, the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
30,111,movement,[37,4],"The agent is currently at position [39,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [37,4] and [39,6], both at distance 2.0. Moving to either position would maximize welfare. Choosing [37,4] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
30,138,movement,[14,39],"The agent is currently at position [15, 39] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions all have sugar values of 3 or less. Among these, the maximum sugar value is 3, and there are multiple positions with this value at distance 1 or slightly more. The nearest positions with sugar value 3 are [14, 39] and [16, 39], both at distance 1. Moving to either would increase the agent's sugar intake from 1 to 3. Choosing [14, 39] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
30,56,movement,[31,13],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: (32,12), (31,13), and (32,14). Choosing (31,13) as it is unoccupied and closest, providing maximum welfare."
30,121,movement,[30,15],"The agent is currently at position [31, 15] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [30, 15], [32, 15], and [31, 16]. Moving to any of these positions will increase the agent's welfare. Choosing [30, 15] as it is the first found with maximum sugar value and minimum distance."
30,59,movement,[10,36],"The agent is currently at position [10, 35] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 5. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have sugar value 3 except for the current position and some others with lower sugar values. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are at distance 1 or 1.41, such as [10, 36], [11, 36], [10, 37], and [12, 36]. The closest is [10, 36] at distance 1. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while being the nearest position with maximum sugar value."
30,108,movement,[33,6],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 within its vision range. All these positions are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value available in the visible positions. The nearest such position is at [33,6] with a distance of 1.41. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by moving to the highest sugar value position closest to its current location."
30,115,movement,[28,10],"The agent is currently at position [28,11] with sugar value 1.0. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 within its vision range. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [28,10] and [28,12]. Both positions are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to [28,10] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) and is unoccupied."
30,8,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is much lower than the sugar values of occupied neighboring positions. Since all positions with higher sugar values are occupied, moving would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should stay in its current position."
30,144,movement,[33,1],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see several positions around it. Among the visible positions, the ones with the highest sugar value are at positions [33,1] and [34,2], both with sugar value 2.0 and distance 1.0. However, these positions are unoccupied, unlike the positions with higher sugar values (30.0, 19.0, 12.5, 11.5) which are occupied. Therefore, the agent will move to one of these positions with maximum sugar value and closest distance. Choosing [33,1] as the target position."
30,58,movement,[30,9],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Several positions have this sugar value, but the closest ones are at distance 1.0: [30,9], [31,10], and [30,11]. The agent chooses to move to [30,9] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
30,93,movement,[31,2],"The agent is currently at position [31,3] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values are at distance 1.0 with sugar value 2.0, such as [31,2], [30,3], and [31,4]. Among these, [31,2] is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value of 2.0 at the nearest distance. Therefore, the agent should move to [31,2] to maximize welfare."
30,40,movement,[11,43],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, for example at (11,43). Moving to (11,43) maximizes welfare by moving to the nearest position with the highest sugar value available."
30,60,movement,[34,13],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is lower than the sugar values of occupied neighboring positions. The agent's current position has a sugar value of 1.0, which is less than the maximum visible sugar value of 3.0. Among the visible positions with sugar value 3.0, the nearest ones are at distance 1.0 (positions [34,13] and [35,14]). Both are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value available within vision. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, choosing [34,13]."
30,75,movement,[27,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, positions [27,2] and [27,4] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since both are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, moving to either is beneficial. Choosing [27,2] arbitrarily."

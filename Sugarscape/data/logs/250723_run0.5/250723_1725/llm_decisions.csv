26,37,movement,[36,8],"The agent is currently at position [37,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 to 3.16. The closest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0 is at [36,8] or [38,9], both at distance 1.0 or 1.41 respectively. Choosing [36,8] as it is the closest with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
26,122,movement,[13,38],"The agent is currently at position [13, 41] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar values up to 4. The highest sugar value visible in unoccupied positions is 4, found at positions [13, 38], [16, 43], and [18, 40]. Among these, [13, 38] is the closest at a distance of 3.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [13, 38] to maximize welfare."
26,66,movement,[37,6],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [38,5], [37,6], and [39,6]. Since all have equal sugar and distance, I choose to move to [37,6] arbitrarily among these options."
26,71,movement,[20,35],"The agent is currently at position [19, 35] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Several positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [20, 35] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [20, 35] to maximize welfare."
26,8,movement,[33,11],"The agent is currently at position [33,7] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are at [33,11] with sugar 4.0 and at [32,7], [34,7], [34,6], [35,7] all with sugar 3.0. Among these, [33,11] has the maximum sugar value but is at distance 4.0, which is within the agent's vision. Since the agent should move to the nearest position producing maximum welfare, it will move to [33,11]."
26,134,movement,[30,6],"The agent is currently at position [30,5] with sugar 27. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 2 or 3, with no occupied positions among them. The maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3 are [29,6] at distance 1.41 and [30,6] at distance 1.0. The closest is [30,6]. Therefore, the agent should move to [30,6] to maximize welfare."
26,55,movement,[35,4],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are not occupied. The highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at positions [35,4], [34,6], [32,5], and [34,7]. Among these, [35,4] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent moves to [35,4] to maximize its welfare."
26,90,movement,[18,40],"The agent is currently at position [18, 38] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at position [18, 40], which is within the agent's vision range and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare as per the movement rule."
26,135,movement,[33,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [33,3], [35,2], [33,4], [36,3], and [34,5] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest of these is [33,3] at a distance of 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare by collecting the highest available sugar at the closest distance."
26,117,movement,[34,10],"The agent is currently at position [34,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. The closest such positions are [34,10] and [35,8], both at a distance of about 1.0 to 1.41. The agent chooses to move to [34,10] as it is the closest position with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
26,72,movement,[36,10],"The agent is currently at position [36,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances ranging from 1.0 to 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [36,10] at distance 1.0 and [35,8] at distance 1.41. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [36,10]."
26,40,movement,[11,41],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Among these, position [11,41] is unoccupied and closest with sugar 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare."
26,139,movement,[31,2],"All visible unoccupied positions within vision have the same sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to one of these positions to maximize welfare."
26,93,movement,[32,5],"The agent is currently at position [31,4] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [32,5], [29,6], [32,7], and [31,8], each with sugar value 3. Among these, [32,5] is the closest at a distance of 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [32,5] to maximize welfare."
26,52,movement,[32,7],"The agent is currently at position [33,8] with sugar 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 3.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distances 1.41 and 2.0. The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [32,7] or [34,7]. Choosing [32,7] as it is unoccupied and closest."
26,11,movement,[32,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [32,2], [32,4], and [33,4] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. They are all at distances 1 or 1.41, which is within vision. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar, [32,2] or [32,4] at distance 1.0 is optimal. I select [32,2] as the target position to move to."
26,11,reproduction,[38],"The agent 11 is male, age 27, with sugar 23.0 which is above the minimum required 8.0 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 38, who is female, age 26, with sugar 23.5. Both have empty neighboring sites (agent 11 has [32,3] and agent 38 has [33,1] and [34,2]), satisfying the reproduction conditions. Since max_partners is 2 and only one eligible partner is available, agent 38 is selected for reproduction."
26,46,movement,[16,37],"The agent is currently at position [17, 37] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available nearby. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Choosing the closest one at distance 1.0, the agent can move to either [16, 37] or [18, 37]. Both are equally good, so the agent moves to [16, 37]."
26,14,movement,[11,34],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the positions [11,34] and [10,35] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are at distances 1.41 and 2.0 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [11,34]. Therefore, the agent should move to [11,34] to maximize welfare."
26,128,movement,[32,10],"The agent is currently at position [32,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0 at positions [32,10], [31,8], and [30,10]. All these positions are at distances 1.0, 1.41, and 2.24 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [32,10] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [32,10] to maximize welfare."
26,80,movement,[29,7],"The agent is currently at position [30,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0 at multiple positions ([29,7], [29,6], [31,8], [28,8], [28,9], [30,10], [34,7], [34,6], [35,7], [30,12], [35,8], [29,12], [31,12], [30,13]).

4,42,movement,[24,11],"All visible positions within vision have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest such position, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, the agent can choose any; choosing position [24,11] as it is one of the nearest with maximum sugar."
4,84,movement,[33,12],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at position [33,12], which is unoccupied and within vision. This position is at a distance of 3.61, which is acceptable. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by collecting more sugar."
4,10,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. There is no unoccupied position with higher sugar value to move to, so the agent should stay in place."
4,36,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
4,95,movement,[32,10],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at position [32,10], which is unoccupied and within vision distance 4.0. Other positions have sugar values of 3.0 or less. Therefore, the agent moves to [32,10] to maximize welfare."
4,55,movement,[32,7],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, position [32,7] at distance 1.0 is selected for movement."
4,35,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 4, so it can only consider positions within a distance of 4 from its current position (31,50). All visible positions with sugar values greater than 0 are far away (distances around 46 or more), which are beyond the agent's vision range. Within the vision range, all positions have sugar value 0. Therefore, there is no better position to move to within vision. The agent should not move."
4,54,movement,[17,40],"The agent is currently at position [16, 41] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3, but many of these positions are at a distance greater than 1 and are unoccupied. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.41 (e.g., [17, 40]). Moving to [17, 40] provides the maximum welfare (sugar value 3) at the nearest distance. Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 40]."
4,77,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare, there is no benefit in moving."
4,56,movement,[38,11],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is lower than the sugar at the current position (1.0). However, the current position has sugar 1.0, so moving to any position with sugar 3.0 is beneficial. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have sugar 3.0 except a few with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.41 (38,11) and 2.0 (39,10). The closest is (38,11) at distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to (38,11) to maximize welfare."
4,44,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see positions with sugar values of 0 within this range. Since all nearby positions within vision have zero sugar and the current position also has zero sugar, there is no better position to move to. Therefore, the agent should not move."
4,87,movement,[20,43],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [20,43], [19,44], and [21,44] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar value and distance, moving to any of these maximizes welfare. Choosing [20,43] arbitrarily as the target position."
4,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0 except the current position which also has 0 sugar. Therefore, there is no better position to move to for increasing welfare."
4,32,movement,[25,37],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is any adjacent position with sugar value 2.0 at distance 1.0. The agent selects position [25,37] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
4,7,movement,[10,37],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [10,37], [11,38], and [10,39] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0. All are at equal distance (1.0). Choosing to move to [10,37] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare and unoccupied."
4,73,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the agent is already on a position with maximum sugar value and no other positions offer better welfare, the agent will not move."
4,74,movement,[38,1],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see three unoccupied positions within that range: [38,1] with sugar 2.0, [39,2] with sugar 2.0, and its current position [39,1] with sugar 1.0. Both [38,1] and [39,2] have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are at distance 1. Since both are equally good, the agent can move to either. Choosing [38,1] arbitrarily."
4,70,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have zero sugar value, so there is no benefit in moving."
4,92,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 2 and can only consider positions within that range. All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 0, which is not better than the current position's sugar value of 0. Therefore, there is no benefit in moving."
4,50,movement,[14,35],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [14, 35] at distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while minimizing movement distance."
4,57,movement,[15,43],"The agent is currently at position [15, 41] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with higher sugar values (3.0) are available and unoccupied within vision range. The closest such positions are at distance 2.0 to 2.24, for example [15, 43], [13, 42], and [14, 43]. Among these, [15, 43] is the nearest with maximum sugar value 3.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 43] to maximize welfare."
4,1,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. There is no unoccupied position with higher sugar value to move to, so the agent will stay in place."
4,97,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar and are either occupied or have no better sugar value than the current position. Therefore, moving does not increase welfare."

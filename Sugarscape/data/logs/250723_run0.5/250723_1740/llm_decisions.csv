29,115,movement,[28,11],"The agent is currently at position [29,11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0, available at multiple positions such as [28,11], [29,12], [28,12], [28,9], [28,8], [32,10], and [32,12]. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [28,11] and [29,12]. Choosing [28,11] as it is the closest and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare within vision range."
29,23,movement,[35,4],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [35,4] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to the current position's sugar value of 1.0 and other nearby positions with sugar values of 2.0 or less."
29,136,movement,[35,2],"The agent can see several positions within its vision range. Among the unoccupied positions, [35,2] and [34,3] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Both are at distances within the agent's vision (1.41 and 2.0 respectively). The agent chooses to move to [35,2] because it is closer (distance 1.41) and has the maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions."
29,67,movement,[9,42],"The agent is currently at position [8, 42] with sugar value 1.0. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied or further away. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41, such as [9, 42], [9, 41], and [9, 43]. Among these, [9, 42] is the closest and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare within vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [9, 42]."
29,53,movement,[36,10],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the vision range. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.41 (e.g., [36,10]) and 2.0 (e.g., [39,11], [37,13]). The closest maximum sugar position is [36,10] at distance 1.41, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,10] to maximize welfare."
29,148,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. The agent is currently at position [19,39] with sugar value 3.0. Since the current position already has the maximum sugar value and moving to any other position with the same sugar value does not provide a welfare advantage, the agent will not move."
29,8,movement,[32,10],"The agent is currently at position [33,9] with sugar value 1. The agent can see several unoccupied positions within its vision range, all with sugar value 3 except for some with sugar value 2 or 1. The maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are [32,10] and [34,10], both at distance 1.41. The agent will move to one of these positions to maximize welfare and minimize distance. Choosing [32,10] arbitrarily as it is equally good as [34,10]."
29,84,movement,[34,6],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the positions [34,6], [35,6], [34,7], [35,7], [36,6], and [35,8] all have the highest sugar value of 3.0. The nearest among these is [34,6] with a distance of 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,6] to maximize welfare."
29,80,movement,[28,8],"The agent is currently at position [29,8] with sugar 1.0. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3.0 or 2.0, but many of the higher sugar positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are [28,8] and [28,9], both at distance 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. Among these, [28,8] is the closest and has the maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions. Therefore, the agent should move to [28,8]."
29,66,movement,[36,6],"The agent is currently at position [36,5] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances 1.0 to 3.16. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are [36,6] and [35,6] at distances 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [36,6]."
29,14,movement,[12,35],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, those with the highest sugar value are 3.0 at positions [12,35], [11,34], [15,34], and [13,36]. All these positions have the same sugar value, so the agent should move to the nearest one. The distances are 1.41 for [12,35], 2.0 for [11,34], 2.0 for [15,34], and 2.0 for [13,36]. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [12,35]."
29,135,movement,[32,3],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar are at distance 1.0: [32,3], [34,3], and [33,4]. Since all are unoccupied and equally good in sugar value and distance, moving to any of these positions is beneficial. Choosing [32,3] as the target position arbitrarily among the best options."
29,7,movement,[13,29],"Among the visible positions, the position [13, 29] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare within the agent's vision range."
29,114,movement,[34,10],"The agent is currently at position [34,9] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [34,10], [35,8], [34,7], and [34,11], each with sugar value 3. Among these, [34,10] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [34,10] to maximize welfare."
29,85,movement,[39,7],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is not higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. However, the current position is occupied by the agent itself, and the agent can move to a nearby unoccupied position with sugar value 3.0. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The agent chooses to move to position [39,7], which is unoccupied, has sugar value 3.0, and is the nearest position with maximum welfare within vision range."
29,140,movement,[11,38],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some farther ones with less sugar. The agent is currently at position [11,39] with sugar value 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1 or 1.41, such as [11,38], [10,39], and [11,40]. However, these positions are unoccupied and within vision. Moving to any of these positions will increase the agent's sugar intake. Choosing [11,38] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
29,126,movement,[11,34],"The agent is currently at position [11, 35] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 to 2.24, specifically positions [11, 34], [10, 35], and [12, 36]. All these positions are unoccupied. The closest among these is [11, 34] and [10, 35] at distance 1.0. Choosing [11, 34] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare within vision range."
29,133,movement,[9,38],"The agent is currently at position [9,37] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [9,38], [8,38], and [10,38], all at distances around 1.0 to 1.41. All these positions are unoccupied. Moving to any of these positions will maximize the agent's welfare. Choosing the closest one, [9,38], is optimal."
29,74,movement,[26,4],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [26,4] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to the current position and other nearby positions."
29,104,movement,[18,42],"The agent is currently at position [17, 41] with sugar value 1. All adjacent positions with higher sugar values are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value available are at distance 1.41 or more with sugar value 3. The closest such position is [18, 42] with sugar value 3 and distance 1.41. Moving there maximizes welfare within vision and is unoccupied."

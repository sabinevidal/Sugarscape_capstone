15,72,movement,[36,13],"The agent is currently at position [36,11] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar values up to 4. The highest sugar value visible in unoccupied positions is 4, found at positions [36,13] and [36,8]. Both are at distances 2 and 3 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar value is [36,13] at distance 2, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,13] to maximize welfare."
15,42,movement,[26,4],"All visible positions within vision have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Choosing position [26,4] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value."
15,24,movement,[17,41],"The agent is currently at position [15, 41] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 6. The highest sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 4, found at positions [17, 41] and [13, 40]. Both are at distances 2.0 and 2.24 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [17, 41]. Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 41] to maximize welfare."
15,26,movement,[40,5],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with lower values. Since all positions with maximum sugar value (3.0) are unoccupied and at distances 1 or 1.41, the agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, the agent can choose any of the positions [40,5], [39,6], or [40,7]. Choosing [40,5] as it is directly above the current position and equally optimal."
15,67,movement,[13,40],"The agent is currently at position [14, 41] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 5. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4 at position [13, 40]. This position is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing its sugar intake."
15,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
15,56,movement,[36,8],"The agent is currently at position [36,12] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 5, and it can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 at various distances. Since the movement rule is to move to the nearest position producing maximum welfare, the agent should move to the closest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4 at position [36,8], which is at distance 4. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3 closer than 4, but since 4 is higher, the agent should move to [36,8]."
15,50,movement,[13,43],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0. Choosing the closest one, position [13,43], to maximize welfare and minimize movement cost."
15,31,movement,[9,39],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 within its vision range. All these positions have the maximum sugar value available in the visible area and are unoccupied. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [9,39], [8,40], and [10,40]. The agent will choose to move to one of these closest positions with maximum sugar value. Choosing [9,39] as it is directly adjacent and has maximum sugar value 3.0."
15,90,movement,[10,40],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [10,40] and [10,42]. Choosing to move to [10,40] as it is the first encountered position with maximum welfare at minimum distance."
15,66,movement,[36,4],"The agent is currently at position [35,4] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with higher sugar values (3.0) are available at [36,4], [35,5], and [36,6]. Among these, [36,4] and [35,5] are at distance 1, and [36,6] is at distance 2.24. Since [36,4] and [35,5] have the same sugar value and distance, either can be chosen. I choose to move to [36,4] as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision range."
15,7,movement,[13,33],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [13,33] and [14,34] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Since both are equally good in terms of welfare and distance, moving to either is beneficial. Choosing [13,33] arbitrarily as the target position."
15,37,movement,[39,12],"The agent is currently at position [38,12] with sugar value 1. All visible positions within vision have sugar value 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1 (positions [39,12] and [38,13]). Both are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, choosing [39,12]."
15,8,movement,[35,11],"The agent's vision is 4, and it can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar value 3. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3 are at distance 1: [35,11] and [35,13]. Both have the same sugar value and distance, so the agent can choose either. Moving to [35,11] is chosen arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision."
15,58,movement,[34,8],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distances 1.0 to 1.41. Choosing the closest one at distance 1.0, position [34,8], maximizes welfare while minimizing movement cost."
15,96,movement,[14,36],"The agent is currently at position [14, 37] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0, but all these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0, which is at distance 1.0 or 1.41. Among these, position [14, 36] is at distance 1.0 and unoccupied, so the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
15,40,movement,[13,38],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.41 (position [13,38]) and distance 2.0 (positions [12,39], [12,40], [16,40]). The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [13,38]. Therefore, the agent should move to [13,38]."
15,59,movement,[16,40],"The agent is currently at position [16, 41] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are at [16, 40], [17, 40], and [17, 42], each with sugar value 3. Among these, [16, 40] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 40] to maximize welfare."
15,54,movement,[15,43],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with lower values. The agent is currently at position [16, 43] with sugar 1.0. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [15, 43], [17, 43], and [16, 44]. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [15, 43]."
15,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
15,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0 except the current position which also has 0 sugar. There are no unoccupied positions with higher sugar value within vision range to move to. Therefore, the agent should not move."

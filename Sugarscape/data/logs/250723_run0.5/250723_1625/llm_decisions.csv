8,22,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent will stay in place."
8,71,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is equal to the current position's sugar value. Since the current position is unoccupied and already provides maximum welfare, there is no benefit in moving."
8,74,movement,[34,1],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [34,1], [36,1], and [35,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [34,1] arbitrarily among them."
8,87,movement,[21,40],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the positions [21,40], [20,41], and [22,41] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Since all are equally near and have the same sugar value, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [21,40] as the target position."
8,3,movement,[35,4],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [35, 4] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare according to the movement rule."
8,27,movement,[30,1],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [30,1], [32,1], and [31,2] each have the maximum sugar value of 2.0. All are at distance 1.0, so the agent can move to any of these to maximize welfare. Choosing [30,1] arbitrarily among these options."
8,56,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [36, 10] with sugar 14. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 4, but all these positions are at a distance of 1 or more and have sugar value 4, which is less than the agent's current sugar. Since the agent aims to move to the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar) that is unoccupied, and all nearby positions have lower sugar than the current position, the agent should not move."
8,59,movement,[16,37],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value visible is 4.0 at positions [16,37], [16,38], and [17,38]. Among these, [16,37] is the closest at a distance of 3.0. All these positions are unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [16,37] to maximize welfare."
8,34,movement,[8,31],"Among the visible positions within vision range, positions [8,31], [10,31], and [9,32] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent can move to any of these to maximize welfare. Choosing [8,31] as it is equally optimal and adjacent."
8,85,movement,[35,7],"The agent is currently at position [36,7] with sugar value 1. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 4.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 4.0 are [35,7] at distance 1.0, [37,8] at distance 1.41, [34,7] at distance 2.0, and [36,9] at distance 2.0. The closest position with maximum sugar value is [35,7]. This position is unoccupied, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
8,40,movement,[18,40],"The agent is currently at position [18, 41] with sugar 18. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are those with sugar 4.0 at positions [18, 40], [17, 40], and [17, 42]. Among these, [18, 40] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [18, 40] to maximize welfare."
8,67,movement,[13,39],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at position [13,39], which is unoccupied and within vision. This position is the best choice for maximizing welfare."
8,75,movement,[36,1],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [36,1], [38,1], and [37,2] all have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally near and have the same sugar value, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [36,1] arbitrarily among these options."
8,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. There is no unoccupied position with higher sugar value to move to."
8,11,movement,[33,3],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the positions [33,3] and [33,5] have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are at the same distance (1.41). Choosing [33,3] as the target position to maximize welfare."
8,50,movement,[15,43],"The agent is currently at position [16, 43] with sugar value 1. There are several nearby unoccupied positions with higher sugar values of 4 at distances 1.0 to 5.0. Among these, positions [15, 43] and [17, 42] are the closest with sugar value 4 and distance 1.0. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [15, 43]."
8,24,movement,[17,40],"The agent is currently at position [16, 41] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4, located at positions [17, 40], [17, 42], [18, 39], [16, 38], [17, 38], and [13, 40]. Among these, [17, 40] and [17, 42] are closest (distance 1.41) and unoccupied. Choosing [17, 40] as the target position to maximize welfare and minimize distance."
8,72,movement,[36,9],"The agent is currently at position [35, 9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 4.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 4.0 at distances 1.0 and 2.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 4.0 are [36, 9] and [35, 10], both at distance 1.0. The agent will move to one of these positions to maximize welfare and minimize distance. Choosing [36, 9] arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar value."
8,82,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any increase in welfare, the agent should stay in place."
8,30,movement,[13,40],"The agent is currently at position [11, 40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the position [13, 40] has the highest sugar value of 4.0 and is within the agent's vision range. Therefore, moving to [13, 40] maximizes the agent's welfare."

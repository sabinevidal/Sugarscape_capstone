7,59,movement,[16,34],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0. Among the positions with sugar value 3.0, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The agent is currently at position [16,35] with sugar 1.0. Moving to any of the closest positions with sugar 3.0 will maximize welfare. The closest such positions are [16,34], [17,35], [15,34], [17,34], and [15,36]. Among these, [16,34] is directly north and at distance 1.0, so it is chosen for movement."
7,88,movement,[15,41],"The agent is currently at position [15, 42] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are all 4, located at [15, 41], [16, 42], [14, 41], [16, 41], and [16, 43]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 4 are at distance 1: [15, 41] and [16, 42]. Choosing [15, 41] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare at minimum distance."
7,13,movement,[14,40],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0, found at multiple positions: [14,40], [15,40], [12,40], [14,41], and [16,41]. Among these, the closest is [14,40] at a distance of 3.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [14,40]."
7,6,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare, there is no benefit in moving."
7,5,movement,[15,40],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0, found at multiple positions: [15,40], [12,40], [14,41], [16,41], [17,41], and [16,42]. Among these, the closest is [15,40] at a distance of 2.24. Therefore, the agent will move to [15,40]."
7,15,movement,[32,13],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0. Choosing one of these nearest positions, for example [32, 13], maximizes welfare while minimizing movement distance."
7,64,movement,[35,8],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range to find the one with the maximum sugar value. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [35,8] and [36,7]. Both are at similar distances (4.24 and 4.47 respectively). The agent chooses to move to [35,8] as it is slightly closer and provides maximum welfare (sugar)."
7,31,movement,[14,41],"The agent is currently at position [15, 38] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4, located at positions [14, 41], [16, 41], [12, 40], [17, 41], and [16, 42]. Among these, the closest positions are [14, 41] and [16, 41] at a distance of approximately 3.16. Both are unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to one of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [14, 41] as the target position."
7,22,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have zero sugar value, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying put conserves energy and avoids unnecessary movement."
7,60,movement,[36,8],"The agent is currently at position [34, 10] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [36, 8] and [36, 7]. Both are within vision range and unoccupied. The nearest of these is [36, 8] at distance 2.83, which is closer than [36, 7] at distance 3.61. Therefore, the agent should move to [36, 8] to maximize welfare."
7,85,movement,[36,7],"The agent is currently at position [34,8] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [36,7] with sugar 4.0 and [34,7], [35,7], [32,8], [33,6], [32,7], [36,9], [35,10], [32,10], [36,10], [31,8], [37,8], [33,5], [35,5], [37,7], [33,11], [35,11], [36,5] all with sugar 3.0. Among these, [36,7] has the highest sugar value and is within vision range and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,7] to maximize welfare."
7,100,movement,[17,41],"The agent is currently at position [20, 40] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are at [17, 41], [16, 41], and [16, 42], each with sugar value 4. Among these, [17, 41] is the closest (distance 3.16). Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 41] to maximize welfare."
7,56,movement,[36,10],"The agent is currently at position [37,10] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions all have sugar values of 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are [36,10] at distance 1.0 and [36,9] and [38,11] at distance approximately 1.41. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [36,10]."
7,14,movement,[13,36],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. Several positions have this sugar value, but some are occupied (e.g., [12,38]). The unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 and closest distance are [13,36] and [12,37], both at distance 1.0. Choosing [13,36] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare."
7,75,movement,[37,1],"Among the unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [37,1], [39,1], and [38,2] all have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally good in terms of welfare and distance, moving to any of these positions is beneficial. Choosing [37,1] arbitrarily as the target position."
7,71,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is equal to the current position's sugar value. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare (sugar value 1.0), there is no benefit in moving."
7,42,movement,[24,8],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, any position with sugar value 2.0 and distance 1.0 is optimal. The agent selects position [24,8] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
7,84,movement,[30,12],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [30,12] and [31,13]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing to move to [30,12] as it is the first found nearest position with maximum sugar."

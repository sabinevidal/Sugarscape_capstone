31,108,movement,[33,5],"The agent is currently at position [33,6] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have sugar values of 3.0 or 2.0. The positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 to 3.16, and the closest such positions are [33,5] and [33,7] at distance 1.0. Since both have the maximum sugar value of 3.0 and are equally close, the agent can move to either. Choosing [33,5] arbitrarily as the target position to maximize welfare and minimize distance."
31,26,movement,[38,4],"Among the visible positions, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [38,4] and [38,6]. Both are equally good in terms of sugar and distance. Choosing [38,4] arbitrarily as the target position to move to maximize welfare."
31,14,movement,[13,34],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The closest position with maximum sugar is [13,34] at distance 1.0, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [13,34] to maximize welfare."
31,96,movement,[12,39],"The agent is currently at position [9,39]. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the one with the highest sugar value is [12,39] with a sugar value of 4.0 and a distance of 3.0. This position offers the maximum welfare within the agent's vision and is unoccupied, so the agent should move there."
31,50,movement,[14,42],"The agent is currently at position [15, 43]. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0, available at positions [14, 42], [15, 41], and [16, 39]. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [14, 42] at a distance of approximately 1.41, which is closer than the other two. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 42] to maximize welfare."
31,137,movement,[15,37],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the position [15, 37] has the highest sugar value of 4.0. This position is unoccupied and within vision distance, so moving there maximizes the agent's welfare."
31,142,movement,[31,5],"The agent is currently at position [32,6] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances ranging from 1.41 to 4.12. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are [31,5] and [33,7], both at distance 1.41. Choosing [31,5] as it is the first found nearest position with maximum sugar value."
31,103,movement,[36,11],"The agent is currently at position [35, 11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 4.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 4.0 are [36, 11] at distance 1.0 and [34, 12] at distance 1.41. The closest position with maximum sugar is [36, 11]. Therefore, the agent should move to [36, 11] to maximize welfare."
31,15,movement,[37,9],"The agent is currently at position [38,8] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [37,9], [38,10], and [38,11], each with sugar value 4. Among these, [37,9] is the closest at a distance of 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,9] to maximize welfare."
31,116,movement,[16,38],"The agent is currently at position [17,36] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar values mostly 3 or 4. The highest sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 4, found at positions [16,38] and [16,39], both at distances 2.24 and 3.16 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 4 is [16,38]. Therefore, the agent should move to [16,38] to maximize welfare."
31,52,movement,[38,10],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [38,10], [34,12], and [38,11]. Among these, [38,10] is the closest at a distance of 3.61. Therefore, the agent will move to [38,10]."
31,80,movement,[29,9],"The agent is currently at position [28,9] with sugar 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3.0, but many of these positions are unoccupied. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41, such as [29,9], [29,8], and [29,10]. Since these positions are unoccupied and have the highest sugar value visible, the agent should move to the nearest one, which is [29,9]."
31,80,reproduction,[58],"Agent 80 is female, age 32, with sugar 66 which is above the minimum required for reproduction (10). The eligible partner is agent 58, male, age 31, with sugar 62. Agent 58 is within vision range and fertile. Both agents have empty neighboring sites (agent 80 has three empty nearby positions and agent 58 has two). Since all reproduction conditions are met and max partners is 3, agent 58 is selected as a partner for reproduction."
31,127,movement,[34,12],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are unoccupied. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [34,12] and [38,11]. Among these, [34,12] is closer (distance 1.41) compared to [38,11] (distance 5.0). Therefore, the agent moves to [34,12] to maximize welfare while minimizing travel distance."
31,30,movement,[13,30],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [13,30], which is unoccupied and has maximum welfare (sugar value 2.0) at the nearest distance."
31,104,movement,[15,41],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 4.0 at position [15, 41], which is at a distance of 3.61. All other unoccupied positions have sugar values of 3.0 or less. Therefore, the agent moves to [15, 41] to maximize its welfare."
31,122,movement,[13,43],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available nearby. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [13,43] which is unoccupied and has sugar value 3.0, maximizing welfare and minimizing distance."
31,111,movement,[37,3],"The agent can move to positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances 1.0 and 1.41, which are unoccupied and provide maximum welfare within vision. Among these, the closest position with maximum sugar is [37,3] at distance 1.0."

21,121,movement,[35,14],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [35,14] and [36,15]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [35,14] as it is the first found nearest position with maximum sugar value."
21,46,movement,[18,38],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [18,38] and [19,39]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [18,38] as it is directly adjacent and closer in terms of coordinates."
21,50,movement,[12,42],"The agent is currently at position [12, 43] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0: [12, 42], [11, 43], and [12, 44]. All these positions are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to [12, 42] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value, satisfying the movement rule."
21,12,movement,[33,5],"The agent is currently at position [34,6] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [33,5], [34,4], [37,8], [30,5], and [30,7]. The nearest of these is [33,5] at distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,5] to maximize welfare."
21,122,movement,[18,41],"The agent is currently at position [18,40] with sugar value 2.0. All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [18,41] and [19,39]. Both positions are unoccupied. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [18,41]."
21,113,movement,[30,2],"The agent can see three positions within its vision: its current position (30,1) with sugar 1.0, position (30,2) with sugar 2.0, and position (31,1) with sugar 1.0. The position (29,1) is occupied and cannot be moved to. Among the unoccupied positions, (30,2) has the highest sugar value (2.0) and is within vision range. Therefore, the agent should move to (30,2) to maximize welfare."
22,101,movement,[37,8],"The agent is currently at position [39,6] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 4, with the highest sugar value of 4 at position [37,8]. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision. Moving to [37,8] will maximize the agent's welfare by moving to the nearest position with the highest sugar value available."
22,106,movement,[14,43],"The agent is currently at position [14, 41] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [14, 43] and [16, 43], both at a distance of 2.0 and 2.83 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar value is [14, 43]. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 43] to maximize welfare."
22,129,movement,[30,7],"The agent is currently at position [31,7] with sugar value 3.0. All visible positions have sugar values of 3.0 or less, but many of the positions with sugar value 3.0 are occupied. The unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [30,7], [31,5], [29,7], [31,9], [30,5], [29,6], [29,8], [29,9], [31,4], [28,8], [34,8], and [31,11]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1 or 2. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value is [30,7] at distance 1. Therefore, the agent should move to [30,7]."
22,55,movement,[31,4],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are unoccupied. The maximum sugar value available in these positions is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The agent chooses to move to position [31,4], which has sugar value 3.0 and is at distance 1.0, as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare and is unoccupied."
22,5,movement,[15,38],"The agent is currently at position [15, 36] with sugar value 1. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the position [15, 38] has the highest sugar value of 4.0 and is within the agent's vision range. It is also the nearest position with maximum welfare. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 38]."
22,108,movement,[36,12],"The agent is currently at position [36, 11] with sugar 10.5. Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [36, 12] has the highest sugar value of 4.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare as it provides the highest sugar gain nearby. Other positions have lower sugar values or are occupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [36, 12]."
22,111,movement,[38,4],"The agent is currently at position [37,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at position [38,4], which is within vision range and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare."
22,24,movement,[16,43],"The agent is currently at position [13, 41] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at position [16, 43], which is within the agent's vision range and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare."
22,84,movement,[35,5],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the sugar at the current position (1.0). However, the current position has sugar value 1.0, so moving to any position with sugar value 3.0 is beneficial. Among the visible unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0, the closest is at position [35,5] with distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,5] to maximize welfare."
22,112,movement,[16,40],"The agent is currently at position [16, 41] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, and several positions with sugar value 3 are unoccupied and at distance 1 or slightly more. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are [16, 40], [15, 42], and [17, 42], all at distance 1 or 1.41. Among these, [16, 40] is the closest at distance 1. Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 40] to maximize welfare."
22,103,movement,[34,9],"The agent is currently at position [35,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0 to 4.47. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [34,9] and [36,9]. Both are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value available within vision. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar, choosing [34,9] as it is equally close and has maximum sugar value."
22,118,movement,[17,42],"The agent is currently at position [17, 41] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. Several positions with sugar value 3.0 are available within vision range and are unoccupied. The nearest such positions are [17, 42], [18, 40], and [18, 42], all at distance approximately 1.41 or less. The closest is [17, 42] at distance 1.0, which is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value. Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 42] to maximize welfare."
22,116,movement,[9,40],"The agent is currently at position [10,40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except a few with 2.0. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. The closest such positions are at distance 1.0: [9,40] and [10,41]. Both are unoccupied and have sugar value 3.0. The agent can choose either; here, it moves to [9,40]."
22,120,movement,[33,11],"The agent is currently at position [33,10] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0 or 2.0. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [33,11] at distance 1.0 and [31,9] at distance 2.24. The agent will move to [33,11] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare and is unoccupied."

27,107,movement,[32,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [32,1] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to the current position [33,1] with sugar 1.0 and the other visible position [34,1] with sugar 1.0, which is also unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [32,1]."
27,23,movement,[37,4],"The agent is currently at position [36,3] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [37,4] and [36,5], both unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [37,4] at distance 1.41, which is closer than [36,5] at distance 2.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,4] to maximize welfare."
27,23,reproduction,[66],"Agent 23 is male, has sufficient sugar (53.0) above the minimum required (23.0) for reproduction, and has one eligible partner, agent 66, who is female, fertile, within vision range, and also has empty neighboring sites. Both agents have empty adjacent sites, fulfilling the reproduction conditions. Therefore, agent 23 should reproduce with agent 66."
27,12,movement,[33,6],"The agent is currently at position [34,7]. The visible unoccupied positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3.0 at positions [33,6], [35,6], [33,5], [35,9], [36,5], and [33,4]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.41: [33,6] and [35,6]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [33,6]."
27,67,movement,[8,41],"The agent is currently at position [9, 41] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0, available at multiple positions within vision range. All these positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [8, 41], [10, 41], and [9, 42]. Choosing the closest one, [8, 41], to maximize welfare and minimize movement distance."
27,106,movement,[14,39],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [14,39] and [15,40]. The agent chooses to move to [14,39] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare and is unoccupied."
27,5,movement,[19,40],"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0. Since all these positions are unoccupied and have equal sugar value, the agent can move to any of these nearest positions. Choosing position [19,40] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
27,59,movement,[10,36],"The agent is currently at position [10, 35] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0, available at multiple positions such as [10, 36], [12, 37], [13, 34], [10, 39], [11, 39], and [15, 35]. The nearest position with sugar value 3.0 is [10, 36] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [10, 36] to maximize welfare."
27,132,movement,[34,3],"The agent can move to any of the visible unoccupied positions with sugar value 2.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [34,3]. Moving there maximizes sugar gain while minimizing movement distance."
27,119,movement,[40,7],"The agent is currently at position [39,7] with sugar 21. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but some of these positions are occupied or out of vision range. Among the unoccupied visible positions with sugar 3.0, the closest is [40,7] at distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while being the nearest position with maximum sugar value available."
27,137,movement,[14,33],"The agent is currently at position [14,34] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [14,33], [13,34], and [15,35], all at distance 1.0 or 1.41. Since [14,33] and [13,34] are closer (distance 1.0) than [15,35] (distance 1.41), the agent will move to one of these. Choosing [14,33] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
27,131,movement,[16,34],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [16,34], [15,35], and [16,33] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. They are all at a distance of 1 or 1.41, which is within vision. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar, [16,34] is at distance 1 and unoccupied, so moving there maximizes welfare."
27,15,movement,[39,10],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with lower values. The agent is currently at position [39,11] with sugar value 1.0. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41, such as [39,10], [38,12], and [40,12]. Among these, [39,10] is the closest at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [39,10] to maximize welfare."
27,60,movement,[35,9],"The agent is currently at position [35,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances ranging from 1.0 to 6.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [35,9] at distance 1.0 and [35,6] at distance 2.0. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [35,9]."
27,40,movement,[10,41],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the sugar value at the current position (1.0). The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Among these, the closest positions are [10,41] and [12,40] at distance 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The agent chooses to move to [10,41], which is the nearest position with maximum welfare (sugar value 3.0)."
27,109,movement,[41,10],"The agent is currently at position [40, 10] with sugar value 1.0. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [41, 10] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [41, 10] to maximize welfare."
27,108,movement,[32,11],"The agent is currently at position [32, 12] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. All positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and at distances ranging from 1.0 to 4.0. The nearest such position is [32, 11] at distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare by moving to the highest sugar value position closest to the agent."
27,121,movement,[32,14],"The agent is currently at position [32, 13] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby visible positions with the highest sugar value (3.0) are at [32, 14], [31, 14], and [33, 14], all unoccupied and at distance 1.0 to 1.41. Among these, [32, 14] is the closest with maximum sugar value. Therefore, the agent should move to [32, 14] to maximize welfare."
27,103,movement,[36,11],"The agent is currently at position [34,11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at multiple unoccupied positions such as [36,11], [36,13], [37,11], [34,14], [37,12], [33,14], [35,14], etc. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [36,11] at distance 2.0.

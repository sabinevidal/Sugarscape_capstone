2,33,movement,[27,2],"All visible unoccupied positions within vision have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0. The agent is currently on a position with sugar value 1.0. Moving to any adjacent position with sugar value 2.0 will increase welfare. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [27,2] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
2,7,movement,[9,38],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [9,38], [8,39], and [10,39] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are at the same distance of 1.0. Since all these positions are unoccupied, the agent can move to any of them. Choosing [9,38] as the target position arbitrarily among the best options."
2,23,movement,[33,4],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0 is at [33,4] with distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,4] to maximize welfare."
2,51,movement,[38,9],"The agent is currently at position [41,6] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are at [38,9], [37,8], and [36,7], each with sugar value 4.0. Among these, [38,9] is the closest (distance 4.24). Therefore, the agent should move to [38,9] to maximize welfare."
2,78,movement,[34,1],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see three unoccupied positions within its vision: [34,1] with sugar 2.0, [35,2] with sugar 2.0, and its current position [35,1] with sugar 1.0. Both [34,1] and [35,2] have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are at distance 1. Since both are equally good, the agent can move to either. Choosing [34,1] arbitrarily."
2,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. There is no unoccupied position with higher sugar value to move to."
2,84,movement,[30,15],"The agent is currently at position [26, 16] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [30, 15] and [31, 16]. Both are within the agent's vision range (5 units). The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [30, 15] at distance 4.12, which is closer than [31, 16] at distance 5.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [30, 15] to maximize welfare."
2,93,movement,[25,6],"The agent has a vision of 4 and sees multiple positions with sugar value 2.0 at distance 1.0, which is the maximum sugar value available in visible positions. Among these, the closest positions are [25,6], [26,7], and [25,8]. Position [26,7] is occupied, so it is excluded. Positions [25,6] and [25,8] are unoccupied and equally close. The agent can move to either. Choosing [25,6] arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare at the nearest distance."
2,4,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any increase in welfare, the agent will stay in its current position."
2,34,movement,[7,32],"All adjacent positions have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Choosing to move to position [7, 32] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare."
2,63,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent will stay in place."
2,82,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent will stay in place."
2,87,movement,[20,45],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [20,45] and [19,46] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is equally optimal. Choosing to move to [20,45]."
2,59,movement,[17,34],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [17,34]. Moving there maximizes welfare and is the closest option."
2,2,movement,[13,41],"The agent is currently at position [13, 42]. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 4.0. Several positions with sugar value 4.0 are available and unoccupied: [13, 41], [14, 41], [12, 40], [14, 40], [15, 41], [15, 40], [16, 42], [14, 39], [16, 41], [16, 43], [15, 39], [17, 42], [14, 38], and [17, 41]. The nearest positions with sugar 4.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest positions with sugar 4.0 and unoccupied are [13, 41] and [14, 41] at distances 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar, the agent should move to [13, 41]."
2,44,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see positions with sugar values up to 2. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value (2) are very far away (distance 48 or 49), which is beyond the agent's vision range. Within the vision range, all positions have sugar value 0. Therefore, the agent should not move as no better position is visible within its vision."
2,22,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
2,18,movement,[43,17],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [43,17] and [42,18]. Choosing [43,17] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
2,8,movement,[33,16],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Since all positions with maximum sugar value (3.0) are unoccupied, the agent should move to the nearest one. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [33,16] and [34,17]. The agent can move to either. Choosing [33,16]."
2,30,movement,[14,38],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the positions [14, 38] and [15, 39] have the highest sugar value of 4.0. Both are within vision range and unoccupied. The position [14, 38] is closer (distance 1.41) compared to [15, 39] (distance 2.0). Therefore, moving to [14, 38] maximizes welfare while minimizing distance."
3,3,movement,[33,5],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [33,5] and [32,6] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are at the same distance (1.0). Choosing to move to [33,5] as it is one of the optimal positions with maximum welfare."

1,33,movement,[28,2],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, all positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0, which is the maximum welfare available. The nearest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [28,2] and [27,3]. Choosing [28,2] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
1,48,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position also has zero sugar. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
1,44,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 2, so it can only consider positions within distance 2. All visible positions within vision have sugar value 0, including the current position. Therefore, there is no better position to move to for increasing welfare."
1,85,movement,[26,14],"The agent is currently at position [25,14] with sugar value 1. The nearest unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value visible are at distance 1.0 to 1.41 with sugar value 2. Among these, position [26,14] is unoccupied and has sugar value 2, which is higher than the current position's sugar value. Therefore, the agent should move to [26,14] to maximize welfare."
1,2,movement,[13,42],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [13,42] and [12,41], both at distances 4.47 and 5.1 respectively. The nearest among these is [13,42] at distance 4.47. Therefore, the agent will move to [13,42]."
1,76,movement,[23,28],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 1.0 except the current position which also has 1.0. Since the current position is occupied by the agent itself and has the same sugar value as all other unoccupied visible positions, the agent can move to any of the nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 1.0. The nearest positions with sugar 1.0 are at distance 1.0, such as (23,28) or (24,29). Choosing (23,28) as it is unoccupied and nearest with maximum welfare."
1,3,movement,[31,5],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [31,5] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare according to the movement rule."
1,83,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position also has zero sugar. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will not move."
1,56,movement,[42,11],"The agent is currently at position [42, 12] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4 at position [37, 12], but it is 5 units away. There are several positions with sugar value 3 within 1 to 3 units distance, such as [42, 11], [41, 12], and [41, 11]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1. Moving to any of these positions will maximize welfare while being close. Since [42, 11] is unoccupied and has sugar value 3, the agent should move there."
1,46,movement,[17,40],"The agent is currently at position [18, 40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 4.0. Several positions with sugar value 4.0 are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest positions with sugar value 4.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The agent will move to the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value, which is [17, 40] or [18, 41]. Choosing [17, 40] as it is the closest with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
1,53,movement,[34,7],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 4.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (4.0) are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [34,7], [36,7], and [35,8]. Among these, any can be chosen as they are equally good and unoccupied. I choose to move to [34,7]."
1,90,movement,[20,35],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [20,35] and [21,36], both at distances greater than 4. The agent chooses the nearest among these, which is [20,35] at distance 4.24. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by collecting the highest sugar available nearby."
1,84,movement,[26,16],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [26,16] and [27,17]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing the position [26,16] as it is directly adjacent and has maximum welfare (sugar value)."
1,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, so moving does not increase welfare. Staying in the current position is optimal."
1,11,movement,[34,3],"All visible positions with maximum sugar value (3.0) are unoccupied and at distance 1 or slightly more. The agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing position [34, 3] as it is the first in the list with maximum sugar and within vision range."
1,41,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have a sugar value of 0.0, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying in place conserves energy and avoids unnecessary movement."
1,43,movement,[46,8],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value (2.0) are at distance 1.0. Since all these positions are unoccupied, the agent will move to one of these nearest positions with maximum sugar value. Choosing position [46,8] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
1,47,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
1,7,movement,[9,39],"All adjacent positions have the same maximum sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. The agent can move to any of these positions. Choosing to move to position [9, 39] arbitrarily among the options."
1,73,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare equal to neighbors, the agent will not move."
1,25,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. There is no benefit in moving to any other position as they do not provide higher welfare."
1,9,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
1,59,movement,[18,34],"The agent's vision is 5, and it can see several positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value visible is 3.0 at position [18,34], which is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare as it provides the maximum sugar within vision range and is unoccupied."
1,75,movement,[42,2],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [42, 2] and [43, 3] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is equally good. Choosing to move to [42, 2]."
1,24,movement,[15,43],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0, found at positions [15,43], [16,43], [14,42], [15,42], and [14,41]. Among these, [15,43] is the closest with a distance of 4.12. Therefore, the agent will move to [15,43]."
1,62,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is the maximum welfare available. Since the current position also has a sugar value of 1.0 and is unoccupied, the agent does not need to move to improve welfare."
1,72,movement,[33,11],"The agent is currently at position [33, 12] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 4.0. Several positions with sugar value 4.0 are unoccupied and at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [33, 11] at distance 1.0 and sugar 4.0."
1,99,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
1,19,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position is unoccupied and also has zero sugar. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."

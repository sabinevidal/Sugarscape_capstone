2,86,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent will stay in place."
2,77,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0 and are unoccupied. The agent is currently at position [13, 25] which already has a sugar value of 1.0. Since moving does not provide any increase in sugar value, the agent will stay in its current position to avoid unnecessary movement."
2,11,movement,[33,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, several have the maximum sugar value of 3.0. These positions are [33,3], [34,4], [33,4], [35,4], [36,3], and [34,5]. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [33,3] and [34,4]. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [33,3]."
2,28,movement,[27,16],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among these, the position [27,16] is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar value 2.0. Therefore, moving to [27,16] maximizes welfare."
2,19,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any increase in welfare, the agent will stay in place to conserve energy."
2,55,movement,[31,6],"The agent has a vision of 3 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 within its vision range. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [31,6] and [30,7]. Both are unoccupied and have the highest sugar value visible. The agent chooses to move to [31,6] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (sugar value 3.0) and is unoccupied."
2,53,movement,[34,8],"The agent is currently at position [34,7] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 4.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The unoccupied positions with sugar value 4.0 within vision are [34,8], [35,8], [36,7], [36,8], [35,9], [36,9], [34,10], [37,8], [35,10], [37,9], [36,10], [34,11], [35,11], [37,10], [38,9], [36,11], [34,12], and [35,12]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 4.0 are [34,8] (distance 1.0) and [35,8] (distance 1.41). The nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) is [34,8]. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,8]."
2,65,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have the same sugar value of 1.0. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare equal to the neighbors, the agent will not move."
2,88,movement,[14,42],"The agent is currently at position [14, 43] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 4 or 3, but positions with sugar value 4 are unoccupied and closer. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 4 are at distance 1 or 2, such as [14, 42] (distance 1) and [14, 41] (distance 2). Among these, [14, 42] is the closest and has the maximum sugar value. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 42]."
2,6,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the agent is already on a position with maximum welfare (sugar value 1.0) and no unoccupied position offers higher sugar, the agent will not move."
2,48,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving to any other position does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
2,36,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have a sugar value of 0.0, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying in place conserves energy and avoids unnecessary movement."
2,90,movement,[20,36],"The agent is currently at position [20, 35] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range all have sugar value 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0: [20, 36]. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within the agent's vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [20, 36]."
2,13,movement,[16,33],"The agent is currently at position [17,33] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, and all these positions are unoccupied. The nearest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1 (positions [16,33] and [17,34]). Moving to either of these positions will maximize the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake. Choosing position [16,33] as it is the closest and unoccupied."
2,57,movement,[12,39],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [12,39] and [12,40], both at distances around 4.12-4.47. The agent chooses the nearest one, [12,39], to maximize welfare and minimize travel distance."
2,54,movement,[14,37],"The agent is currently at position [9, 36] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can move to any unoccupied position within this range. The occupied positions within vision are [7,33], [9,37], [13,38], [9,39], and [12,39]. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4 at position [14, 37], but it is at distance 5.1 and unoccupied. The agent can move there. Since it is the position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) within vision and unoccupied, the agent should move to [14, 37]."
2,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
2,64,movement,[29,7],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [29,7] and [30,7]. Among these, [29,7] is closer (distance 5.0) compared to [30,7] (distance 6.0). Therefore, the agent will move to [29,7]."
2,98,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar and are either occupied or have no better sugar value than the current position. Therefore, the agent should not move to avoid wasting metabolism without gaining sugar."
2,49,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have zero sugar value, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying put conserves energy and avoids unnecessary movement."
2,20,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."

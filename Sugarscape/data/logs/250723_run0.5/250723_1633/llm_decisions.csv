10,2,movement,[15,36],"The agent is currently at position [15,37] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3, but many of these positions are occupied or out of reach. Among the unoccupied positions with sugar value 3, the closest is [15,36] at distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare by moving to the highest sugar value position within vision and is unoccupied."
10,82,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position also has zero sugar. Since no position offers better welfare, the agent will not move."
10,39,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have a sugar value of 0.0, so there is no benefit in moving to any other position."
10,85,movement,[32,8],"The agent is currently at position [32,9] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0: [32,8] and [31,9]. Both are unoccupied and have the highest sugar value available within vision. The agent will move to the closest such position, choosing [32,8]."
10,75,movement,[34,1],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [34,1], [36,1], and [35,2] all have the maximum sugar value of 2.0. Since all have equal sugar and are at the same distance, moving to any of these positions is equally beneficial. Choosing to move to [34,1]."
10,27,movement,[28,1],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [28,1], [30,1], and [29,2] all have the maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are at distance 1.0. Since all have equal welfare and distance, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [28,1] arbitrarily as the target position."
10,81,movement,[30,6],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the sugar values of neighboring occupied positions. However, the agent can only move to unoccupied positions. Among the unoccupied visible positions, all have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: (30,6), (29,7), (31,7), and (30,8). Since the agent is currently at (30,7), moving to any of these positions yields the same welfare. Choosing (30,6) as it is directly north and unoccupied."
10,66,movement,[34,3],"The agent has a vision of 4 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value visible is 3.0, but many of these positions with sugar 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is at [34,3] with sugar 3.0 and distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare by moving to the nearest position with the highest sugar available."
10,40,movement,[19,39],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [19, 39] and [19, 41]. Choosing [19, 39] as the target position to move to, as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare at the nearest distance."
10,31,movement,[11,42],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0: [11,42] and [12,43]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [11,42] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
10,55,movement,[32,4],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are not occupied. The highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at positions [32,4], [33,6], [34,4], [31,7], and [33,7]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [32,4] (distance 1.0) and [33,6] (distance 1.41). The agent chooses to move to [32,4] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar welfare and is unoccupied."
10,73,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any increase in sugar welfare and all adjacent positions are unoccupied, the agent will stay in place to conserve energy."
10,54,movement,[15,41],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0, and the current position has sugar value 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. Among these, positions [15,41], [14,41], and [16,41] are unoccupied and closest. Choosing [15,41] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
10,53,movement,[33,6],"The agent is currently at position [34,6] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 3. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are [33,6], [35,6], and [33,7], all at distance 1 or 1.41. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [33,6]."
10,14,movement,[13,33],"Among the visible positions, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with lower values. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [13,33] and [14,34]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [13,33] as it is directly adjacent and provides maximum welfare."
10,67,movement,[14,39],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the vision range. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0 or 2.0. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is at [14, 39] with sugar 3.0 and distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare and is the nearest such position."
10,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have sugar value 0 except the current position which also has sugar value 0. Therefore, there is no better position to move to for maximizing welfare."
10,77,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare (sugar value), there is no benefit in moving."
10,5,movement,[17,36],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The agent should move to the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value, which is 3.0. The closest such positions are at distance 1.0: [17,36] and [18,37]. Choosing [17,36] as it is the closest and unoccupied."
10,100,movement,[18,41],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 (positions [18,41], [19,42], [18,43]). Among these, [18,41] is chosen as it is the closest and unoccupied."
10,58,movement,[31,7],"The agent is currently at position [32,6] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [31,7] and [33,7], both with sugar value 3. These positions are at distance 1.41, which is within the agent's vision of 3. Moving to either position would maximize welfare. Choosing [31,7] as the target position."
10,7,movement,[12,35],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [12, 35] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare as per the movement rule."
10,88,movement,[14,41],"The agent is currently at position [14, 42] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, but all these positions are unoccupied and at various distances. The closest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are [14, 41] at distance 1, [13, 41] and [13, 43] at distance 1.41. Among these, [14, 41] is the nearest position with maximum sugar and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 41] to maximize welfare."
10,42,movement,[24,7],"All visible positions within vision range have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, it selects the position [24, 7] as it is one of the closest and provides maximum welfare."
10,20,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
10,19,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
10,23,movement,[37,4],"Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [37,4] and [37,5]. Both are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [37,4] at distance 1.0, which is closer than [37,5] at distance 2.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,4] to maximize welfare."
10,52,movement,[31,9],"The agent is currently at position [31,10] with sugar 30. The visible positions within vision range all have sugar value 3, which is the maximum available sugar in unoccupied positions nearby. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3 are at distance 1 (positions [31,9] and [30,10]). Both are unoccupied and have the same sugar value. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar welfare, the agent will move to [31,9]."
10,63,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Moving to any other position would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."

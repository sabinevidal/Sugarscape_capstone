26,130,movement,[16,36],"The agent is currently at position [14, 35] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0 at positions [16, 36], [16, 38], and [13, 39]. Among these, [16, 36] is the closest (distance 2.24) and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 36] to maximize welfare."
27,140,movement,[12,39],"The agent is currently at position [9, 39] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 5. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4 at positions [12, 39] and [13, 39]. Both are at distances 3 and 4 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar value is [12, 39] at distance 3. Therefore, the agent should move to [12, 39] to maximize welfare."
27,114,movement,[35,11],"The agent is currently at position [35,7] with sugar 12. The visible positions within vision range that are unoccupied have sugar values mostly 3 or 4. The highest sugar value among unoccupied positions is 4 at position [35,11], which is at distance 4. Moving there maximizes welfare within vision and is the nearest position with maximum sugar value."
27,125,movement,[13,39],"The agent is currently at position [12, 38] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 5. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 4.0, found at positions [13, 39], [14, 40], and [16, 38]. The closest of these is [13, 39] at distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [13, 39] to maximize welfare."
27,110,movement,[38,11],"The agent is currently at position [37,14] with sugar 12.5. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [38,11] and [38,10]. Both positions are unoccupied and at distances approximately 3.16 and 4.12 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [38,11]. Therefore, the agent should move to [38,11] to maximize welfare."
27,141,movement,[30,8],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value among visible unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at positions [30,8], [28,10], [30,9], [31,6], [31,10], [30,11], [32,6], [30,12], and [29,13]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [30,8], [28,10], and [30,9], all at a distance of 2.0 to 2.24. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar, the agent will move to [30,8]."
27,84,movement,[34,5],"All visible unoccupied positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [34,5], [33,6], and [35,6]. Among these, [34,5] is chosen as it is directly adjacent and thus the closest position with maximum welfare."
27,138,movement,[16,38],"The agent is currently at position [16, 35]. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at position [16, 38], which is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare as it provides the highest sugar value nearby. Other positions have lower sugar values or are occupied."
27,143,movement,[20,37],"The agent is currently at position [20, 36] with sugar value 1.0. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [21, 36] and [20, 37]. Both are unoccupied and have the maximum welfare (sugar value) available within vision. The agent will move to the closest such position, choosing [20, 37] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
27,66,movement,[37,5],"The agent is currently at position [37,6] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but some of these positions are occupied. The unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 and closest distance are [37,5], [36,5], [38,5], and [36,7]. Among these, [37,5] is the closest (distance 1.0) and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,5] to maximize welfare."
27,7,movement,[13,29],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [13,29], [15,29], and [14,30] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all have equal sugar value and equal distance, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [13,29] arbitrarily among these options."
27,55,movement,[36,4],"The agent is currently at position [35,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value available is 3.0 at multiple positions: [36,4], [36,5], [33,4], [37,4], [35,6], and [33,5]. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 ([36,4]) and 1.41 ([36,5], [33,4], [37,4]). The closest position with maximum sugar is [36,4]. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,4] to maximize welfare."
27,14,movement,[12,34],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 2.0. The closest position with sugar 3.0 is at [12,34] with distance 1.0, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
27,136,movement,[35,1],"All nearby positions with higher sugar values are occupied. The only unoccupied visible positions have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value 2.0 at position [35,1]."
27,57,movement,[13,42],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 4.0. Among these positions, the closest one with sugar value 4.0 is at coordinates [13, 42] with a distance of 3.61, which is within the agent's vision of 6. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by collecting the highest sugar available nearby."
27,31,movement,[14,40],"The agent is currently at position [13,37] with sugar value 1. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the position [14,40] has the highest sugar value of 4.0 and is within the agent's vision range. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake. It is also the nearest position with the maximum sugar value available."
27,38,movement,[36,2],"All adjacent positions within vision are either occupied or have a sugar value of 2.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value (2.0) are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. Among these, position [36,2] is unoccupied and closest with sugar 2.0, so moving there maximizes welfare."
27,38,reproduction,[23],"Agent 38 is female, age 28, with sugar exactly at the minimum required for reproduction (17.0). There is one eligible partner, agent 23, who is male, age 27, within vision range, fertile, and has an empty neighboring site at position [37,3]. Agent 38 also has multiple empty neighboring sites. Since both agents meet the reproduction criteria and agent 38 can reproduce with up to 1 partner, reproduction will occur with agent 23."
27,101,movement,[38,10],"The agent is currently at position [36,6] with sugar 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision are evaluated for maximum sugar value. The highest sugar value among unoccupied positions is 4.0 at position [38,10], but it is at a distance of 4.47. There are several positions with sugar value 3.0 at closer distances (1.0 to 3.61). The nearest position with maximum sugar value is [38,10] with sugar 4.0, but it is farther than some positions with sugar 3.0. According to the movement rule, the agent should move to the nearest position producing maximum welfare. Since 4.0 is the maximum sugar value visible, the agent should move to [38,10]."

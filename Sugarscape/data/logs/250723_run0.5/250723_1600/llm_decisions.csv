1,23,movement,[32,4],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distances 1.0, 1.41, and 2.0. The closest position with sugar 3.0 is at [32,4] with distance 1.0, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
1,26,movement,[44,16],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 2.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [44,16] and [43,17]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [44,16] as it is directly north and closer in terms of coordinates."
1,78,movement,[35,1],"Among the unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [35,1], [37,1], and [36,2] all have the maximum sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally good in terms of welfare and distance, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [35,1] arbitrarily as the target position."
1,97,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, which is not better than the current position's sugar value. Therefore, moving would not increase welfare."
1,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
1,45,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position also has zero sugar. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
1,30,movement,[15,37],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 4.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 4.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The positions at distance 1.0 with sugar 4.0 are [15,37] and [16,38]. However, [16,38] is occupied by another agent (id 40). Therefore, the best unoccupied position with maximum sugar and minimum distance is [15,37]."
1,31,movement,[17,39],"The agent is currently at position [18, 39] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 4 or 3, but positions with sugar value 4 are unoccupied and closer than those with sugar value 3. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 4 are at [17, 39] (distance 1), [16, 39] (distance 2), [18, 41] (distance 2), and others at similar distances. Among these, [17, 39] is the closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 4. Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 39] to maximize welfare."
1,57,movement,[8,38],"The agent is currently at position [4, 38] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with the highest sugar value available within vision are those with sugar value 3 at positions [8, 38], [8, 39], [8, 40], [9, 38], [9, 37], and [10, 38]. However, these positions are at distances 4.0 or more, and some intermediate positions closer to the agent have sugar value 2 but are less than the maximum sugar value available. Since the movement rule prioritizes maximum welfare (maximum sugar value) and then nearest position, the agent should move to the nearest position with sugar value 3, which is at distance 4.0 at position [8, 38]. This position is unoccupied and within vision range. Therefore, the agent will move to [8, 38]."
1,98,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position also has zero sugar value. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent should stay in place."
1,87,movement,[20,46],"All adjacent positions have the same sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing to move to position [20,46] as it is the first in the list of equally optimal positions."
1,65,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have the same sugar value of 1.0. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare equal to the neighbors, the agent will not move."
1,67,movement,[12,29],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see several positions with sugar value 2.0 at distances 4.0 and 4.12, which are the highest sugar values available in visible unoccupied positions. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 2.0 are at [12,29] and [13,29]. Both are unoccupied and at the same sugar value. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [12,29]."
1,89,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
1,91,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
1,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. There is no unoccupied position with higher sugar value to move to."
1,100,movement,[19,35],"The agent is currently at position [19, 34] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3, but all these positions are unoccupied and at distances ranging from 1 to 6. The closest positions with sugar value 3 are [19, 35] and [18, 35], both at distance 1 and unoccupied. Moving to either will maximize welfare by increasing sugar intake. Choosing [19, 35] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
1,93,movement,[25,7],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [26,6] and [25,7]. Choosing [25,7] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare at minimum distance."
1,58,movement,[33,10],"The agent is currently at position [32,10] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 4.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 4.0 at distance 1 or 1.41. The nearest positions with maximum sugar are [33,10] and [32,11], both at distance 1.0. The agent will move to [33,10] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
1,27,movement,[37,1],"The agent has three unoccupied positions within its vision range, each with a sugar value of 2.0 at distance 1. Since all have equal sugar value and distance, the agent can move to any of these positions. Choosing position [37, 1] arbitrarily among the best options."
1,35,movement,null,"The agent's vision is 4, so it can only consider positions within a distance of 4. All visible positions within vision have sugar value 0, which is not better than the current position's sugar value (0). Therefore, there is no better position to move to within vision range."
1,1,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. There is no unoccupied position with higher sugar value to move to, so the agent should stay in place."
1,50,movement,[14,29],"The agent's vision is 5, and within this range, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 2.0 at positions [14,29], [13,29], and [15,29]. These positions are at a distance of about 4.0 to 4.12, which is within vision. Among these, any can be chosen as they have equal sugar value and are unoccupied. The agent will move to [14,29] as it is directly north and straightforward to reach."
1,63,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Therefore, there is no benefit in moving to another position."

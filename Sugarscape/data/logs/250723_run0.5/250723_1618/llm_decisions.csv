5,100,movement,[20,41],"The agent is currently at position [19, 41] with sugar value 1. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value is [20, 41] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [20, 41] to maximize welfare."
6,15,movement,[32,14],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 and the current position with 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0, such as [32,14], [33,15], and [32,16]. Among these, [32,14] is the closest and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake."
6,7,movement,[10,35],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [10,35], [9,36], and [11,36] all have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are at distance 1. Since all are unoccupied and equally good in terms of sugar, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [10,35] arbitrarily among these options."
6,20,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
6,4,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
6,74,movement,[36,1],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [36,1], [38,1], and [37,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all have equal sugar value and equal distance, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [36,1] arbitrarily among them."
6,87,movement,[21,42],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [21, 42] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare."
6,58,movement,[33,8],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [33,8] and [34,8] have the highest sugar value of 4.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at a distance of 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar, the agent will move to [33,8]."
6,24,movement,[16,39],"The agent is currently at position [19, 40] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 6. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [16, 40], [16, 39], and [15, 42]. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest among these is at distance 3.0 (positions [16, 40] and [16, 39]). Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [16, 39]."
6,63,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position also has zero sugar. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
6,6,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare equal to the neighbors, the agent will not move."
6,13,movement,[14,37],"The agent is currently at position [16, 36] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are at [14, 37], [14, 38], and [16, 40], each with sugar value 4. Among these, [14, 37] is the closest (distance 2.24). Therefore, the agent will move to [14, 37] to maximize welfare."
6,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
6,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. There is no benefit in moving to any other position as they do not provide higher welfare."
6,3,movement,[34,5],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [34,5] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare based on sugar availability."
6,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
6,17,movement,[10,41],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [10,41], [9,42], and [10,43] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar value and distance, moving to any of these maximizes welfare. Choosing [10,41] arbitrarily among them."
6,11,movement,[33,4],"The agent is currently at position [33,3] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [33,4], [32,4], [34,4], [35,3], and [33,5]. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The closest is [33,4] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,4] to maximize welfare."
6,5,movement,[14,38],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at position [14, 38], which is unoccupied and within vision distance 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other positions with sugar value 3.0 or less."
6,22,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
6,93,movement,[31,5],"The agent is currently at position [30,5] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. Several positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [31,5] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [31,5] to maximize welfare."
6,32,movement,[25,35],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value (2.0) are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [25, 35] which is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
6,57,movement,[14,42],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 4.0, found at positions [14, 42] and [15, 42], both at a distance of 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar, which is [14, 42]."
6,82,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent should stay in place."
6,81,movement,[29,8],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0, such as [29,8], [30,9], and [29,10]. Choosing [29,8] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and nearest distance."

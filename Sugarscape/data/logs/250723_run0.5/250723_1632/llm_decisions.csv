10,60,movement,[33,8],"The agent is currently at position [33,10] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar values up to 4. The nearest positions with the maximum sugar value of 4 within vision are [33,8] at distance 2 and [36,12] at distance 3.61. Both positions are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [33,8]."
10,49,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
10,69,movement,[20,40],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest positions with sugar 3 are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [20,40] as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar."
10,90,movement,[15,39],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the positions [15,39] and [16,39] have the highest sugar value of 4.0. Both are at distances 2.83 and 3.61 respectively. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [15,39]."
10,57,movement,[10,41],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [10,41] and [11,42]. Choosing [10,41] as it is the closest and directly adjacent, allowing the agent to maximize sugar intake efficiently."
10,10,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [39, 45] with sugar value 0.0. The only visible position with sugar is at [39, 1] with sugar value 2.0, but it is 44 units away, which is beyond the agent's vision range of 6. All other visible positions within vision have sugar value 0.0. Therefore, there is no better position within vision to move to. The agent should stay in place."
10,65,movement,[1,36],"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0. Since the current position [2,36] is occupied by the agent and has the same sugar value as the adjacent unoccupied positions, the agent will move to one of the nearest unoccupied positions with maximum welfare. Among the adjacent positions [2,35], [1,36], [3,36], and [2,37], all have equal sugar value and are unoccupied. The agent will choose to move to [1,36] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value."
10,29,movement,[36,12],"The agent is currently at position [34, 13] with sugar value 1. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4 at positions [36, 12] and [37, 11]. Both are at distances within the agent's vision (5). The nearest position with maximum sugar is [36, 12] at distance 2.24. Therefore, the agent should move to [36, 12] to maximize welfare."
10,26,movement,[42,8],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [42,8] and [41,9]. Both are unoccupied and equally good. Choosing [42,8] as it is directly above the current position and equally optimal."
10,95,movement,[37,11],"The agent is currently at position [34, 10] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are [37, 11] with sugar 4, which is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare as it has the highest sugar value among unoccupied positions within vision."
10,80,movement,[34,11],"The agent is currently at position [34,12] with sugar value 1. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, for example [34,11]. Moving to any of these positions will maximize welfare. I choose to move to [34,11] as it is the closest position with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
10,62,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is equal to the current position's sugar value. Since the agent is already on a position with maximum welfare (sugar value 1.0) and no unoccupied position offers higher sugar, the agent will not move."
10,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent will stay in place."
10,15,movement,[31,11],"The agent is currently at position [32, 11] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3, but many of these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1 or slightly more, such as [31, 11] and [31, 12]. Moving to [31, 11] is the closest and highest welfare position available, so the agent should move there to maximize sugar intake."
10,70,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
10,74,movement,[32,1],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [32,1], [34,1], and [33,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all have equal sugar value and equal distance, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [32,1] arbitrarily among them."
10,17,movement,[10,37],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, the positions [10,37], [9,38], and [11,38] all have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Since all are at the same distance (1.0), the agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [10,37] arbitrarily as the target position."
10,34,movement,[8,31],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [8,31], [10,31], and [9,32] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar value and distance, moving to any of these maximizes welfare. Choosing [8,31] arbitrarily as the target position."
10,93,movement,[31,4],"The agent has a vision of 4 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0, which is the maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The position [31,4] is at distance 1.0 and unoccupied, so the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
10,37,movement,[37,6],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [37,6] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare."
10,96,movement,[16,39],"The agent is currently at position [12, 38] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [16, 39] with sugar 4, which is unoccupied and within vision range. This position offers the maximum welfare and is the nearest such position. Therefore, the agent should move there."
10,38,movement,[37,9],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances 1 and 2. The agent should move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is 3.0. Among the positions with sugar 3.0 at distance 1, the positions [38,8], [37,9], and [39,9] are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to [37,9] as it is the closest with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
10,50,movement,[14,44],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available within vision. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [14,44], [16,44], and [15,45]. Since all have equal sugar and distance, the agent can move to any of these unoccupied positions. Choosing [14,44] arbitrarily as the target position."
10,24,movement,[15,40],"The agent is currently at position [16,40] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 are [15,40] and [16,41], both at distance 1. Moving to either would increase the agent's welfare. Choosing [15,40] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
10,72,movement,[36,11],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.41, specifically [36,11] and [38,11]. Both are unoccupied and equally good in terms of sugar. Choosing [36,11] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
10,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
10,8,movement,[34,14],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with lower values. The agent's vision is 4, so it can see all these positions. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [34,14], [36,14], and [35,15]. Among these, any can be chosen as they have equal sugar and distance. Choosing [34,14] as the target position to move to."

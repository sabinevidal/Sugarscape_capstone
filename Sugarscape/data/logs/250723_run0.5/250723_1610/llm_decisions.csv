3,25,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since no position offers better welfare, the agent will not move."
3,57,movement,[15,41],"The agent is currently at position [12, 39] with sugar 10.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [15, 41] and [16, 41]. Both are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest of these is [15, 41] at distance 3.61. Moving there maximizes welfare by moving to the highest sugar value position within vision and unoccupied."
3,53,movement,[36,8],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar values. The maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 4 are at distance 2.0 (position [36,8]). Moving there maximizes welfare by collecting the highest sugar nearby while being unoccupied."
3,13,movement,[15,33],"The agent is currently at position [16, 33] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0, but all these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41, such as [15, 33] and [15, 34]. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [15, 33]."
3,87,movement,[20,44],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [20,44] and [19,45] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are at the same distance (1.0). Choosing to move to [20,44] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare (highest sugar)."
3,69,movement,[23,45],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value (2.0) are at distance 1.0. Choosing one of these positions to move to increases welfare compared to the current position with sugar value 1.0. Selecting position [23,45] as it is one of the nearest with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
3,100,movement,[18,41],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at position [18, 41], but it is at distance 6.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at closer distances (1.0 to 3.16). Since the rule prioritizes maximum welfare first, the agent should move to the position with sugar value 4.0 at [18, 41]."
3,70,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have zero sugar value, so there is no benefit in moving."
3,54,movement,[16,41],"The agent is currently at position [14, 37] with sugar value 1. The agent can see multiple unoccupied positions within its vision range. The position [16, 41] has the highest sugar value of 4 among unoccupied positions and is within the agent's vision (distance 4.47). Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake. Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 41]."
3,24,movement,[16,42],"The agent is currently at position [15, 42] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values up to 4. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 4 are [16, 42] at distance 1.0, [16, 43] at distance 1.41, and [17, 42] at distance 2.0. Among these, [16, 42] is the closest. Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 42] to maximize welfare."
3,62,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is equal to the current position's sugar value. Since the agent is already on a position with maximum welfare (sugar value 1.0) and no unoccupied position offers higher sugar, the agent will not move."
3,50,movement,[14,34],"The agent's vision is 5 and it can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances ranging from 1.0 to 4.12. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value available, which is 3.0. Among the positions with sugar value 3.0, the closest is at position [14, 34] with a distance of 1.0. This position is unoccupied, so the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
3,67,movement,[13,34],"The agent is currently at position [13, 33] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3, and all these positions are unoccupied. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [13, 34] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [13, 34] to maximize welfare."
3,89,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent should stay in place."
3,52,movement,[34,12],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 4.0. The closest positions with sugar value 4.0 are [34,12] and [35,13], both at distance 1. Moving to either position will maximize welfare. Choosing [34,12] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
3,95,movement,[28,10],"The agent is currently at position [28, 11] with sugar 16. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0, but many of these positions are unoccupied. The agent should move to the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value, which is 3.0. Among these, positions [28, 10] and [29, 11] are at distance 1.0 and unoccupied. Choosing [28, 10] as it is the closest and unoccupied."
3,98,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar and are either occupied or not better than the current position. Therefore, the agent should not move."
3,84,movement,[30,14],"The agent is currently at position [30, 15] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. Several positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [30, 14] and [31, 15]. Both have sugar value 3.0 and are unoccupied. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [30, 14]."
3,88,movement,[16,43],"The agent is currently at position [14, 42] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values are at [16, 43], [17, 42], and [17, 41], each with sugar value 4. Among these, [16, 43] is the closest (distance 2.24) and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 43] to maximize welfare."
3,66,movement,[36,7],"The agent is currently at position [37,4] with sugar value 1. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4 at positions [36,7] and [37,8], both within vision range. The nearest position with maximum welfare (sugar value 4) is [36,7] at distance 3.16, which is closer than [37,8] at distance 4.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,7]."
3,40,movement,[17,41],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the position [17, 41] has the highest sugar value of 4.0, which is greater than the sugar value at its current position (1.0). This position is also unoccupied and within the agent's vision. Therefore, moving to [17, 41] maximizes the agent's welfare."
4,25,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since no position offers better welfare, the agent will not move."
4,88,movement,[17,42],"The agent is currently at position [16, 43] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4 at positions [17, 42] and [18, 40]. Both positions are unoccupied and within vision range. Among these, [17, 42] is closer (distance 1.41) compared to [18, 40] (distance 3.61). Therefore, the agent will move to [17, 42] to maximize welfare by moving to the nearest position with maximum sugar value."
4,8,movement,[35,13],"The agent is currently at position [33, 15] with sugar value 1. The nearest unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value (4) are [35, 13] and [33, 12], both within vision range. Both positions are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value available nearby. The distances are 2.83 to [35, 13] and 3.0 to [33, 12]. Therefore, the agent will move to [35, 13] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar)."

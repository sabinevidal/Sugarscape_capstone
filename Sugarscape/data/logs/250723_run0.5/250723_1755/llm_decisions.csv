32,102,movement,[16,43],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. The agent chooses to move to position [16,43], which is unoccupied, has the maximum sugar value of 3.0, and is the nearest such position."
32,30,movement,[12,30],"Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [12,30], [14,30], and [13,31]. Moving to any of these will maximize welfare compared to the current position with sugar value 1.0. I choose to move to [12,30] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
32,71,movement,[19,34],"The agent is currently at position [18, 34] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0, available at multiple positions: [19, 34], [17, 35], [19, 35], [20, 35], [20, 36], [18, 37], [17, 37], and [18, 38]. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [19, 34], [17, 35], and [19, 35], all at distances around 1.0 to 1.41. Choosing the closest one, [19, 34], maximizes welfare and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [19, 34]."
32,124,movement,[34,10],"The agent is currently at position [29,10] with sugar 23.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value on an unoccupied position is 3.0 at [34,10]. This position is within vision (distance 5.0) and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other visible unoccupied positions with lower sugar values (mostly 2.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [34,10]."
32,151,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [31,9] with sugar value 3.0. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values of 2.0 or 1.0, which are less than the current position's sugar value. Therefore, moving would not increase welfare."
32,143,movement,[17,35],"The agent is currently at position [18,35] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 3. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are [17,35] and [19,35], both at distance 1. The agent chooses to move to [17,35] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) and is unoccupied."
32,38,movement,[36,1],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [36,1], [35,2], and [36,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. They are all at a distance of 1 or approximately 1.41. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, [36,1] or [35,2] are equally good. I choose to move to [36,1]."
32,31,movement,[10,38],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at positions [10,38], [12,35], [13,37], and [11,40]. Among these, [10,38] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [10,38]."
32,88,movement,[12,35],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the positions at (12,35) and (13,37) have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are at distances 2.24 and 4.0 respectively. The agent chooses to move to (12,35) as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value)."
32,140,movement,[13,37],"The agent is currently at position [11,35] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [13,37] and [11,40]. Both are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value visible. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [13,37] at a distance of approximately 2.83, closer than [11,40] at distance 5.0."
32,93,movement,[30,3],"The agent is currently at position [31,3] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 2.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 2.0 are [30,3] at distance 1.0 and [30,4] at distance 1.41. Both positions are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [30,3]."
32,150,movement,[37,6],"The agent is currently at position [37,7] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [37,6], [38,6], [35,6], and [36,9], each with sugar value 3. Among these, [37,6] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [37,6] to maximize welfare."
32,15,movement,[36,9],"The agent is currently at position [37,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. These positions are [36,9], [36,10], [40,9], [38,6], [40,10], [38,12], [41,9], and [37,13]. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are [36,9] at distance 1.0 and [36,10] at distance 1.41. The closest position with maximum sugar is [36,9]. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,9]."
32,7,movement,[12,29],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [12, 29] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied, making it the optimal move for maximizing welfare."
32,122,movement,[12,43],"The agent is currently at position [13, 43] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41, such as [12, 43], [12, 42], [12, 44], and [14, 44]. The closest of these is [12, 43] at distance 1.0. Moving there will maximize the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake while being the nearest available spot."
33,80,movement,[28,9],"The agent's vision is 6, and it can see several positions with sugar value 3.0 within its vision range. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at positions [28,9], [30,8], and [28,10]. The agent is currently at [28,8]. Moving to [28,9] is the nearest position with maximum sugar value and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [28,9]."
33,67,movement,[9,39],"The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 5. The maximum sugar value visible in unoccupied positions is 3.0. Among these positions with sugar 3.0, the nearest ones are at distance 1.41: positions [9,39] and [9,41]. Both are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value available. The agent chooses to move to [9,39] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
33,126,movement,[8,38],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 at various distances. Since all these positions have the same maximum sugar value (3.0) within vision, the agent should move to the nearest one to maximize welfare. The nearest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0 is at [8,38], which is at distance 1.0. Moving there will maximize the agent's sugar intake while minimizing movement cost."
33,46,movement,[15,39],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the position [15, 39] has the highest sugar value of 4.0, which is greater than the sugar at its current position (1.0). This position is also unoccupied and within vision distance. Therefore, moving to [15, 39] maximizes the agent's welfare."

28,147,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [37,3] with a sugar value of 3.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at the current position itself. All other visible positions have sugar values of 2.0, which are lower. Therefore, the agent should not move as it is already on the position with maximum welfare."
28,143,movement,[17,38],"The agent is currently at position [20, 37] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [17, 38] and [17, 39]. Both positions are unoccupied and at distances 3.16 and 3.61 respectively. The agent chooses to move to [17, 38], which is the nearest position with maximum sugar value available within its vision range."
28,130,movement,[17,39],"The agent is currently at position [15, 36] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [17, 39] with sugar 4, which is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare as it has the highest sugar value among unoccupied positions within vision."
28,132,movement,[34,4],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [34,4] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare as per the movement rule."
28,121,movement,[31,14],"The agent is currently at position [32,14] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [36,13] with 4 sugar, but it is at a distance of 4.12. There are no closer positions with higher sugar value than 3. Among the positions with sugar value 3, the closest ones are at distance 1, specifically [31,14], [33,14], and [32,15]. Since these positions are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value within the agent's vision, the agent should move to one of these positions. Choosing [31,14] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
28,106,movement,[12,40],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the positions [12,40] and [17,41] have the highest sugar value of 4.0. Both are at distances 2.24 and 3.61 respectively. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [12,40]."
28,66,movement,[36,5],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or less. Among the positions with sugar 3.0, the nearest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The closest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are [36,5], [38,4], and [38,6]. Choosing the closest one at distance 1.0, which is [36,5]."
28,104,movement,[17,41],"The agent is currently at position [17,36] with sugar 21.5. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at position [17,41], which is unoccupied. This position is at distance 5, which is within the agent's vision. Moving there maximizes welfare as it provides the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions within vision."
28,96,movement,[8,40],"The agent is currently at position [8,39] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 to 3.61. The closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [8,40] at distance 1.0, [9,38] and [9,40] at distance 1.41. All these positions are unoccupied. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [8,40]."
28,42,movement,[28,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [28,1], [29,2], and [31,1] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. All are at distances 1 or 2. The nearest positions with maximum sugar are [28,1] and [29,2], both at distance 1. Choosing [28,1] as the target position to move to maximize sugar intake while minimizing movement distance."
28,67,movement,[8,42],"The agent is currently at position [8, 41] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Several positions have this maximum sugar value, but some are occupied (e.g., [10, 41] is occupied). The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [8, 42], [9, 40], and [9, 42], all at distance approximately 1.0 to 1.41. Choosing the closest one, [8, 42], which is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
28,136,movement,[34,1],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within vision range for maximum sugar value. All unoccupied positions have sugar value 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [34,1] and [36,1]. The agent chooses to move to [34,1] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value."
28,30,movement,[12,30],"All visible unoccupied positions within vision have the same sugar value of 2.0. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, any position is equally good, so the agent moves to [12,30]."
28,141,movement,[30,7],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 within its vision range. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [30,7] and [29,8]. Both have the same sugar value and distance, so the agent can move to either. Choosing [30,7] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
28,146,movement,[28,4],"The agent can only see two positions within its vision: its current position (28,3) with sugar value 2.0 and position (28,4) with sugar value 2.0. Both positions have the same sugar value, but the current position is already occupied by the agent. The position (28,4) is unoccupied and has the same sugar value, so moving there would maintain maximum welfare within the agent's vision."
28,122,movement,[14,43],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible range. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is at [14, 43] with sugar 3.0 and distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 43]."
28,53,movement,[37,11],"The agent is currently at position [38,8] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are at [37,11] and [37,12], both with sugar value 4. Among these, [37,11] is closer (distance 3.16) compared to [37,12] (distance 4.12). Therefore, the agent should move to [37,11] to maximize welfare."
28,131,movement,[16,33],"All visible positions with maximum sugar value (3.0) are at distance 1 or approximately 1.41. Since all these positions are unoccupied and have equal sugar value, the agent can move to any of them. Choosing the closest one at distance 1.0, position [16,33], to maximize welfare and minimize movement cost."
28,40,movement,[10,42],"The agent is currently at position [10, 41] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The agent's vision is 5, so it can see all these positions. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41, such as [10, 42], [9, 40], [11, 40], and [9, 42]. Since these positions are unoccupied and have the highest sugar value visible, the agent should move to the nearest one. The closest is [10, 42] at distance 1.0 with sugar 3.0. Therefore, the agent will move to [10, 42]."
28,90,movement,[16,41],"The agent is currently at position [15, 42] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, but many of these positions are unoccupied. The nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value of 3 is at [16, 41], which is at a distance of approximately 1.41. Moving there will maximize the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake."
28,57,movement,[13,41],"The agent is currently at position [13, 42] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1 or 1.41. The agent chooses to move to position [13, 41], which is unoccupied, has sugar value 3, and is the nearest position with maximum welfare."
28,118,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is not higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. However, the current position is occupied by the agent itself, and all adjacent positions with higher sugar values are occupied. The agent cannot move to any unoccupied position with higher sugar value within its vision range. Therefore, the agent will not move."
28,59,movement,[9,36],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to position [9,36]."
28,84,movement,[33,5],"The agent is currently at position [34,5] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. These positions are [33,5], [35,5], [35,6], [33,7], [31,5], [34,8], [31,4], [33,8], [37,7], [32,8], [30,5], [34,9], [38,4], [38,6], [33,9], and [39,5]. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are [33,5] and [35,5], both at distance 1.0. The agent will move to [33,5] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value and is unoccupied."

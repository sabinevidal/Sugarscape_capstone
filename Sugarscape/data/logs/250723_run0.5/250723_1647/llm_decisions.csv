15,30,movement,[9,37],"The agent is currently at position [9, 38] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for [10, 38] with 2.0 and [9, 40] with 1.0. The agent's neighbor at [9, 39] is occupied, so it cannot move there. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The agent will choose the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. The available positions at distance 1.0 with sugar 3.0 are [9, 37] and [8, 38]. The agent will move to [9, 37] as it is directly ahead and has maximum sugar value and is unoccupied."
15,5,movement,[16,37],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.41 (16,37) and 2.0 (15,36). The closest position with maximum sugar is (16,37). It is unoccupied and within vision. Therefore, the agent should move to (16,37) to maximize welfare."
15,12,movement,[35,5],"The agent is currently at position [35,6] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. These positions are [35,5], [36,6], [34,7], [37,7], [32,6], [38,6], [32,5], [38,5], [32,7], [38,7], [34,9], [36,9], [38,4], [31,6], [39,6], [35,10], [39,5], [31,7], [39,7], [39,4], [31,8], [39,8], [40,7]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [35,5] and [36,6] at distance 1.0. Choosing the nearest position with maximum welfare, the agent will move to [35,5]."
15,52,movement,[33,12],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0, such as [33,12], [32,13], [33,14]. Among these, [33,12] is chosen as it is unoccupied and closest. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake."
15,17,movement,[10,32],"All adjacent positions have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Choosing to move to position [10, 32] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare."
15,53,movement,[38,7],"The agent is currently at position [38,8] with sugar value 1. All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0: [38,7] and [39,8]. Both are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [38,7]."
15,75,movement,[31,1],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see three nearby positions: [31,1] with sugar 2.0, [30,2] with sugar 2.0, and its current position [30,1] with sugar 1.0. The position [29,1] is occupied. Among the unoccupied positions within vision, [31,1] and [30,2] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0. The agent can move to either. Choosing [31,1] as it is the first in the visible positions list with max sugar and is unoccupied."
16,69,movement,[18,36],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same maximum sugar value of 3.0. The agent will move to the nearest such position to maximize welfare. Positions at distance 1.0 with sugar 3.0 are [18,36] and [20,36]. The agent chooses to move to [18,36] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
16,56,movement,[36,9],"The agent is currently at position [36,8] with sugar 17. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 4.0 at positions [36,9], [34,7], [34,9], and [35,10]. Among these, [36,9] is the closest (distance 1.0). Moving there maximizes welfare by moving to the highest sugar value position within vision that is unoccupied and nearest."
16,8,movement,[35,10],"The agent is currently at position [35,11] with sugar value 1. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 4.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 4.0 are at distances 1.0 to 2.24, specifically positions [35,10], [33,11], [35,13], and [34,9]. The closest among these is [35,10] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,10] to maximize welfare."
16,14,movement,[16,34],"Among the visible positions, all unoccupied positions have the same maximum sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [16,34], [18,34], and [17,35]. Choosing to move to [16,34] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
16,23,movement,[37,4],"The agent is currently at position [36,3] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values ranging from 2.0 to 3.0. The positions [37,4] and [34,3] have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are at distances 1.41 and 2.0 respectively. Among these, [37,4] is closer. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,4] to maximize welfare."
16,74,movement,[28,1],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the positions [28,1], [30,1], and [29,2] all have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [28,1] arbitrarily as the target position."
16,67,movement,[12,40],"The agent is currently at position [13, 40] with a sugar value of 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [12, 40], [12, 39], [12, 41], and [13, 42], each with a sugar value of 4. Among these, [12, 40] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [12, 40] to maximize welfare."
16,81,movement,[34,7],"The agent is currently at position [31,5] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [34,7] with sugar 4.0, which is unoccupied and within vision range. Other positions have sugar values of 3.0 or less. Moving to [34,7] maximizes welfare as it has the highest sugar value and is unoccupied."
16,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
16,93,movement,[29,6],"The agent has a vision of 4 and sees multiple positions with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.41: [29,6] and [31,6]. Both are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to [29,6] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) and is unoccupied."
16,55,movement,[33,4],"The agent's vision is 3, and it can see several positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1 or slightly more. However, positions [34,5], [35,5], and [36,5] are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are [33,4], [32,5], and [33,6], all at distance 1. The agent can move to any of these. Choosing [33,4] as it is directly north and unoccupied."
16,7,movement,[14,33],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [14, 33] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare as per the movement rule."
16,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
16,58,movement,[34,9],"The agent is currently at position [34,8] with sugar value 1. The nearest unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [34,9] with sugar 4 and distance 1, and [35,7] with sugar 3 and distance approximately 1.41. Among these, [34,9] has the highest sugar value and is the closest unoccupied position. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,9] to maximize welfare."

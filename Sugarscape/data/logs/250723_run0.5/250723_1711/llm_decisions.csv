22,67,movement,[9,37],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in an unoccupied position is 3.0, found at multiple positions such as [9,37], [9,38], [8,38], [8,39], [13,39], [8,40], [9,41], and [10,42]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [9,37] and [9,38], both at distance 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The agent chooses to move to [9,37], which is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) and is unoccupied."
22,133,movement,[9,38],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The maximum sugar value available in these positions is 3.0, found at positions [9,38] and [8,38]. Both are at a distance of approximately 3.16 and 3.61 respectively. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [9,38]."
22,109,movement,[40,14],"The agent is currently at position [39,14] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby positions with the highest sugar value available are all 3.0, but positions [35,14] and [38,14] with higher sugar values (7.5 and 20.0) are occupied. Among the unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0, the closest ones are at distance 1.0: [40,14] and [39,15]. Choosing [40,14] as it is directly adjacent and provides maximum welfare within vision and unoccupied."
22,50,movement,[12,41],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [12,41], [11,42], and [13,42]. Among these, all are unoccupied. Choosing [12,41] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
22,107,movement,[33,1],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see three unoccupied positions within its vision: [33,1] with sugar 2.0, [32,2] with sugar 2.0, and its current position [32,1] with sugar 1.0. Both [33,1] and [32,2] have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum welfare, which is either [33,1] or [32,2]. Both are at distance 1, so the agent can choose either. Choosing [33,1] arbitrarily."
22,85,movement,[37,10],"The agent is currently at position [37,11] with sugar value 1. The agent can see multiple unoccupied positions within its vision range, all with sugar value 3, which is higher than the current position. Since all these positions have the same maximum sugar value, the agent will move to the nearest one to maximize welfare. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 are [37,10], [38,11], [36,10], and [38,12], all at distance 1 or approximately 1.41. The agent will choose to move to [37,10], which is the closest position with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
22,81,movement,[32,9],"The agent is currently at position [32,8] with sugar 50.5. The visible positions with the highest sugar value that are unoccupied are at [32,9] with sugar 4.0. All other positions with higher sugar values are occupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [32,9] to maximize welfare."
22,102,movement,[13,44],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, for example [13,44] and [14,45]. Moving to any of these will maximize welfare by increasing sugar intake. Choosing [13,44] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
23,53,movement,[36,8],"The agent is currently at position [38,6] with sugar 20.0. Among visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 4.0 at positions [36,8], [36,10], and [38,11]. The nearest of these is [36,8] at distance 2.83. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,8] to maximize welfare."
23,122,movement,[16,39],"The agent is currently at position [18,40] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4.0 at positions [16,39], [16,38], [16,37], [15,42], [14,40], and [15,43]. Among these, [16,39] is the closest unoccupied position with sugar 4.0 and within the agent's vision range. Therefore, the agent should move to [16,39] to maximize welfare."
23,87,movement,[14,34],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [14, 34] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare."
23,52,movement,[35,11],"The agent is currently at position [33,12] with sugar 44.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [35,11], [36,10], and [38,11]. These positions are unoccupied and within vision. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [35,11] at distance 2.24. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,11] to maximize welfare."
23,72,movement,[36,10],"The agent is currently at position [31,11] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values mostly 3 or 4, with the highest sugar value of 4 at position [36,10]. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision range (distance 5.1). Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by moving to the position with the highest sugar value available within vision."
23,56,movement,[38,11],"The agent is currently at position [39,8] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [38,11] with 4 sugar, which is unoccupied and within vision range. Other positions with sugar 3 are closer but have lower sugar value. Therefore, moving to [38,11] maximizes welfare and is the nearest position with maximum sugar value."
23,40,movement,[13,39],"The agent is currently at position [14, 38] with sugar value 1. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 4.0. These positions are [13, 39], [16, 38], and [14, 40], all at a distance of 1.41 to 2.0. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 4.0 is [13, 39] at distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [13, 39] to maximize welfare."
23,2,movement,[16,37],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 4.0. Among these positions, the closest ones with sugar value 4.0 are at distances 3.16, 3.61, 4.12, and 6.0. The nearest position with maximum sugar (4.0) is at [16, 37] with a distance of 3.16. Therefore, the agent moves to [16, 37] to maximize its welfare."
23,2,reproduction,[31],"Agent 2 is male, age 24, with sugar 58 which is above the minimum required 6 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 31, who is female, age 23, with sugar 38. Both have empty neighboring positions (agent 2 has three empty spots and agent 31 has two). Since the partner is within vision range and fertile, and the agent has enough sugar, reproduction is possible. Only one partner is available and max_partners is 4, so agent 31 is chosen for reproduction."
23,46,movement,[16,38],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can move to any unoccupied position within this range. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the one with the highest sugar value is at position [16, 38] with a sugar value of 4.0. This position is also the nearest position with the maximum welfare (highest sugar value) available. Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 38] to maximize its sugar intake."

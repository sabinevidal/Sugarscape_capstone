33,90,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [17, 39] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, but all positions with sugar value 3 are occupied or out of reach. Therefore, the agent cannot move to a position with higher sugar value. Staying in place is the best option."
33,38,movement,[35,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [35,1] and [36,2]. Choosing [35,1] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
33,150,movement,[37,5],"The agent is currently at position [37,6] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with the highest sugar value are [37,5], [36,7], [38,8], [35,8], [40,6], and [41,6], all with sugar value 3. Among these, [37,5] is the closest (distance 1.0) and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,5] to maximize welfare."
33,139,movement,[30,5],"The agent is currently at position [30,6] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision are [30,5], [30,7], [29,5], [30,4], [28,6], all with sugar value 2.0. Since these positions have higher sugar value than the current position and are unoccupied, the agent should move to one of these. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 2.0 are [30,5] and [30,7] at distance 1.0. Choosing [30,5] as the target position for movement."
33,107,movement,[30,2],"The agent can only see two positions within its vision: its current position (31,2) with sugar 1.0 and position (30,2) also with sugar 1.0. Both positions have the same sugar value, but the current position is occupied by the agent itself. The position (30,2) is unoccupied and has the same sugar value, so the agent moves there to maximize welfare."
33,121,movement,[29,13],"The agent is currently at position [29,12] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [29,13], [31,12], [30,15], [31,15], [33,11], and [31,16]. The nearest of these is [29,13] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [29,13] to maximize welfare."
33,144,movement,[34,1],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [34,1], [33,2], and [33,3] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. All are at distances 1 or 2. The nearest positions with maximum sugar are [34,1] and [33,2] at distance 1. Either is suitable, but choosing [34,1] arbitrarily as the target position to maximize welfare."
33,110,movement,[40,9],"The agent is currently at position [39,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have sugar value 3.0, which is higher than the current position. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. The closest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are [40,9], [38,8], [40,8], and [40,10]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [40,9]."
33,155,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [29,7] with a sugar value of 3.0. Within its vision range, all visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 2.0 or less. Since the current position has the highest sugar value available and moving to any other position would not increase welfare, the agent should not move."
33,40,movement,[9,42],"The agent is currently at position [10, 42] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby positions with the highest sugar value available and unoccupied are at sugar value 3.0. Among these, the closest positions are [9, 42], [11, 42], [11, 41], and [9, 43], all at distance 1 or approximately 1.41. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [9, 42]."
33,85,movement,[38,12],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0, specifically at coordinates [38,12] and [38,13]. Choosing the closest one at [38,12] to maximize welfare and minimize movement cost."
33,56,movement,[31,12],"The agent is currently at position [32,13] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [31,12] at distance 1.41 and [33,11] at distance 2.24. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum welfare, which is [31,12]."
33,24,movement,[14,40],"The agent is currently at position [16, 40]. Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available in the visible area. The nearest such positions are at distance 2.0 to 2.24 units away. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [14, 40] at distance 2.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 40] to maximize welfare."
33,153,movement,[11,36],"The agent is currently at position [11, 34] with sugar value 1.0. The agent's vision is 5, and it can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar values up to 3.0. The nearest positions with the maximum sugar value of 3.0 are at [11, 36], [10, 36], and [12, 36], all at a distance of 2.0 to 2.24. Since these positions are unoccupied and have the highest sugar value within vision, the agent will move to the nearest one, which is [11, 36]."
33,129,movement,[30,15],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at positions [30,15], [31,15], [31,16], and [32,16]. Among these, the closest position is [30,15] at a distance of 1.0. Therefore, the agent moves to [30,15] to maximize its welfare by collecting the highest available sugar nearby."
33,137,movement,[15,35],"The agent is currently at position [15, 36] with a sugar value of 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value (3.0) are at [15, 35], [17, 36], [17, 37], [12, 36], [18, 37], [14, 39], and [19, 37]. Among these, [15, 35] is the closest (distance 1.0) and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 35] to maximize welfare."
33,151,movement,[32,9],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The position [32,9] is unoccupied, has sugar value 2.0, and is the nearest such position. Therefore, the agent should move to [32,9] to maximize welfare."
33,2,movement,[19,37],"The agent is currently at position [19,36] with sugar value 1.0. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [20,36] and [19,37]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum welfare, the agent will move to [19,37]."
33,108,movement,[36,7],"The agent is currently at position [34,6]. The visible unoccupied positions within vision range have sugar values mostly at 3.0 or less. The highest sugar value among unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at positions [36,7], [35,8], [35,9], [38,8], and [33,11]. Among these, the closest is [36,7] and [35,8] at a distance of approximately 2.24. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [36,7]."
33,52,movement,[38,8],"The agent is currently at position [38,9] with sugar 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3.0, but many of these positions are unoccupied and at a distance of 1 to 3.61. Since the agent should move to the nearest position with maximum welfare (maximum sugar), it will choose the closest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0. The closest such position is [38,8] at distance 1.0 and sugar 3.0, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent will move to [38,8]."

13,20,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
13,80,movement,[32,9],"The agent is currently at position [34,9] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar values up to 4. The nearest positions with the maximum sugar value of 4 are at [32,9] and [32,11], both at a distance of 2 and 2.83 respectively. Among these, [32,9] is the closest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. Therefore, the agent should move to [32,9] to maximize its welfare."
13,30,movement,[10,38],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with maximum welfare (sugar value 3.0) are at distance 1.0. Among these, moving to position [10,38] is chosen arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision range."
13,87,movement,[20,36],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [20, 36] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare as per the movement rule."
13,90,movement,[11,41],"The agent is currently at position [12, 41] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions all have sugar value 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0: [11, 41] and [12, 42]. The agent can move to either of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [11, 41] as it is the first found with max sugar value and minimum distance."
13,67,movement,[12,38],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is at [12,38] with sugar 3.0 and distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [12,38]."
13,54,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the current position's sugar value of 7.0. Moving to any of these positions would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should stay in its current position."
13,39,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have a sugar value of 0.0, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying in the current position is optimal."
13,23,movement,[37,4],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [37,4], [35,6], and [37,6] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. All are at the same distance (approximately 1.41) from the agent's current position [36,5]. Choosing to move to [37,4] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value, which will maximize the agent's welfare."
13,38,movement,[37,6],"Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with lower values. Since the agent aims to maximize welfare by moving to the nearest position with the highest sugar value, it will choose one of the positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0. The positions [37,6] and [38,7] both have sugar value 3.0 and are at distance 1.0. Either is acceptable, but choosing [37,6] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
13,84,movement,[32,11],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value visible in unoccupied positions is 4.0 at position [32, 11]. This position is within vision range and unoccupied, so moving there maximizes welfare."
13,27,movement,[28,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [28, 2] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied, making it the best choice for maximizing welfare. The current position [28, 1] and [27, 1] have lower sugar values and [29, 1] is occupied. Therefore, moving to [28, 2] is optimal."
13,81,movement,[31,4],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 within its vision range. All these positions have the same sugar value, so the agent will choose the nearest one to maximize welfare. The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is at [31,4], which is at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent will move to [31,4]."
13,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have sugar value 0 except the current position which also has sugar value 0. Therefore, there is no better position to move to for maximizing welfare."
13,37,movement,[37,12],"The agent is currently at position [36,9] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [37,12] and [34,13], both with sugar value 4. However, these positions are at distances 3.16 and 4.47 respectively. The closest position with maximum sugar value within vision is [37,12] at distance 3.16, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,12] to maximize welfare."
13,24,movement,[13,37],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. However, the current position is occupied by the agent itself, so it is not considered occupied. The agent should move to the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. All visible positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and at distance 1 or slightly more. The agent chooses to move to position [13,37], which is at distance 1 and has sugar value 3.0, maximizing welfare and being the nearest."
13,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher welfare (sugar value) to move to, the agent will stay in place."
13,100,movement,[19,39],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [19, 39], which is unoccupied and has sugar 3, to maximize welfare and minimize distance."
13,46,movement,[13,35],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [14,34], [13,35], and [15,35]. All these positions are unoccupied. Choosing [13,35] as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar value."
13,71,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is equal to the current position's sugar value. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare (sugar value 1.0), there is no benefit in moving."
13,7,movement,[12,34],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [12, 34] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare according to the movement rule."
13,52,movement,[34,13],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The position [34,13] has the highest sugar value of 4.0 among unoccupied positions, which is greater than the sugar at the current position (1.0). Therefore, the agent moves to [34,13] to maximize its welfare."
13,57,movement,[12,42],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest positions at distance 1.0 are [12,42] and [13,43]. Choosing [12,42] as it is unoccupied and nearest with maximum sugar."
13,58,movement,[33,6],"The agent is currently at position [32,6] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances 1.0 to 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [33,6], [31,7], and [33,7] at distances 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [33,6]."
13,14,movement,[16,33],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with lower values. Among the positions with sugar value 3.0, the closest ones are at distance 1.0: [16,33] and [15,34]. Both are unoccupied and equally good in terms of welfare. Choosing to move to [16,33] as it is the first in the list of maximum welfare positions at minimum distance."
13,13,movement,[16,39],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with lower values. The agent should move to the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. The closest such positions are at distance 1.41, for example [16,39] or [18,41]. Choosing [16,39] as it is the closest with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
13,3,movement,[32,4],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, the position [32,4] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare as per the movement rule."
13,56,movement,[35,14],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [35,14]. Moving there maximizes welfare and is the closest option."

11,7,movement,[11,35],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [11, 35], [13, 35], and [12, 36] all have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal welfare and distance, moving to any of these is beneficial. Choosing [11, 35] arbitrarily as the target position."
11,66,movement,[36,3],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at positions [36,3], [36,4], [33,5], [36,5], and [35,6]. Among these, [36,3] is the closest at a distance of 2.0. Therefore, the agent will move to [36,3]."
11,100,movement,[18,40],"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0: [18,40] and [19,41]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [18,40] as it is directly adjacent and closer in terms of coordinates."
11,34,movement,[9,31],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [9,31] and [8,32] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is optimal. Choosing to move to [9,31]."
11,23,movement,[36,4],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [36,4], [36,5], and [38,5] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. The nearest of these is [36,4] at distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare by obtaining the highest sugar value at the shortest distance."
11,82,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
11,77,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare, the agent will not move."
11,42,movement,[25,7],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [25,7], [24,8], [25,6], [25,8], [26,7], and [24,9] all have the maximum sugar value of 2.0. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [25,7] and [24,8]. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [25,7]."
11,39,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
11,75,movement,[33,1],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [33,1], [35,1], and [34,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing to move to [33,1] arbitrarily among the best options."
11,50,movement,[14,43],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [14,43] which is unoccupied and has sugar 3.0, maximizing welfare and minimizing distance."
11,52,movement,[30,9],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible range. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [31,8] and [30,9]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [30,9] as it is unoccupied and nearest with maximum sugar value."
11,3,movement,[33,5],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, the position [33, 5] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare as per the movement rule."
11,10,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar except the current position which also has zero sugar. The only position with sugar (2.0) is at distance 44, which is beyond the agent's vision range of 6. Therefore, the agent cannot move to a position with higher sugar value within its vision and should stay in place."
11,96,movement,[17,38],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the sugar values of occupied neighboring positions. Since the agent can only move to unoccupied positions and none of the unoccupied positions have higher sugar than the current position (which has sugar 1.0), the agent will move to the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.41, for example [17,38] or [17,40]. Choosing [17,38] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
11,12,movement,[32,7],"The agent is currently at position [33,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [32,7] and [34,7]. Both are unoccupied and have equal sugar value and distance. Choosing [32,7] arbitrarily as the target position to move to maximize welfare and minimize distance."
11,72,movement,[36,10],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible range. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [36,10] and [35,11]. Both are unoccupied and have the same sugar value. Choosing [36,10] as it is directly adjacent and closer in the vertical direction."
11,69,movement,[20,39],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 within its vision range. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [20,39] and [21,40]. Both are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to [20,39] as it is the closest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) and is unoccupied."
11,29,movement,[35,12],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0, and the current position has sugar value 1.0. Among the positions with sugar 3.0, the nearest ones are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The closest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at [35,12], [35,11], [35,13], and [37,13]. Since all have the same sugar value, the agent will move to the nearest one, which is [35,12] at distance 1.0."
11,84,movement,[30,12],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [30,12] and [31,13]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [30,12] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
11,93,movement,[29,6],"The agent is currently at position [31,4] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with higher sugar values are [29,6] and [31,8] with sugar value 3, but [31,8] is at distance 4 which is at the edge of vision. The closest position with maximum sugar value within vision and unoccupied is [29,6] with sugar 3 at distance 2.83. Therefore, the agent should move to [29,6] to maximize welfare."

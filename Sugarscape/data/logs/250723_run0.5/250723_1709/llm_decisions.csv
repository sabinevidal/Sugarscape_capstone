22,104,movement,[17,33],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0, which is the maximum sugar value available within its vision. Among these, the closest positions are [17,33] and [16,34]. The agent will move to [17,33] as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare at the shortest distance."
22,15,movement,[38,14],"The agent is currently at position [37,14] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [38,14] and [37,15]. The agent can move to either of these positions. Choosing [38,14] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
22,59,movement,[12,36],"The agent is currently at position [11, 36] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but the closest among them is at [12, 36] with distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while minimizing movement distance."
22,95,movement,[40,6],"The agent is currently at position [40,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Several positions with sugar value 3.0 are within the agent's vision and are unoccupied. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, for example [40,6] and [41,7]. Choosing [40,6] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare within vision."
22,31,movement,[17,37],"The agent is currently at position [17, 38] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. All positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [17, 37] or [16, 38]. Both have sugar value 3.0 and distance 1.0. Selecting [17, 37] as it is directly adjacent and closer in terms of coordinates."
22,40,movement,[14,38],"The agent is currently at position [14, 39] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with the highest sugar value (3.0) within vision are [14, 38], [13, 39], [14, 40], and [13, 38]. All these positions are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, [14, 38] is chosen as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
22,37,movement,[39,9],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that all have the same sugar value of 3.0. Since the agent is currently on a position with sugar value 1.0, moving to any of these positions will increase its welfare. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, the position [39,9] is chosen as it is unoccupied and closest."
22,26,movement,[39,5],"Among the visible positions, the ones with the highest sugar value are at positions [39,5] and [41,6], both with sugar value 3.0. However, position [41,6] is occupied by another agent, so it is not available. Position [39,5] is unoccupied and within vision range. Therefore, moving to [39,5] maximizes welfare."
22,105,movement,[13,35],"The agent is currently at position [14,36] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.41 to 3.61. The closest such position is [13,35] at distance 1.41. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while being the nearest position with maximum sugar value available."
22,12,movement,[34,4],"The agent is currently at position [33,5] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar values up to 3. The nearest unoccupied positions with the maximum sugar value of 3 are at [34,4], [31,7], and [34,8]. Among these, [34,4] is the closest with a distance of approximately 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,4] to maximize its welfare."
22,12,reproduction,[38],"The agent is male, age 23, with sugar 23.0, which is above the minimum sugar required for reproduction (8.0). There is one eligible partner, agent 38, who is female, age 23, with sugar 46.0, and has empty nearby positions. The agent also has an empty nearby position. Both conditions for reproduction are met: opposite sex, within vision, fertile, and at least one empty neighboring site for either agent. Since max_partners is 2 and only one eligible partner is available, the agent will reproduce with partner 38."
22,13,movement,[17,35],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value to maximize welfare, moving to position [17,35] which is unoccupied and has sugar value 3.0."
22,56,movement,[39,8],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [39,8] at distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar availability while being the nearest such position."
22,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value and are unoccupied, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
22,11,movement,[33,3],"The agent can see several positions within its vision range. Among the unoccupied positions, the ones with the highest sugar value are at positions [33,3], [32,3], [32,5], [33,2], and [35,4], each with a sugar value of 2.0. All these positions are unoccupied and within vision. The closest position with maximum sugar is [33,3] at a distance of 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,3] to maximize its welfare."
22,11,reproduction,[38],"Agent 11 is male, age 23, with sugar 30.0 which is above the minimum required 8.0 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 38, who is female, age 23, with sugar 37.5. Both have empty neighboring sites (agent 11 has three empty nearby positions and agent 38 has one). Since the partner is within vision range and fertile, and the agent has enough sugar, reproduction is possible. Only one partner is available and max_partners is 2, so agent 38 is selected for reproduction."
22,52,movement,[33,12],"The agent is currently at position [34,12] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [33,12], [35,11], and [33,13], all at a distance of 1.0 to 1.41. All these positions are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [33,12]."

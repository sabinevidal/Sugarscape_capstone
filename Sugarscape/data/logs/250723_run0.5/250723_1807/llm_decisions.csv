35,151,movement,[33,8],"The agent is currently at position [33,9] with sugar value 1. The agent can see several unoccupied positions within its vision range. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3, which is the maximum welfare available nearby. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1 or approximately 1.41. The agent will choose the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [33,8] at distance 1. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare."
35,130,movement,[20,38],"The agent is currently at position [19, 38] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, but many of these positions are occupied. The unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 are [20, 38], [20, 37], [18, 39], [19, 36], [21, 38], [20, 36], [21, 37], [21, 39], [21, 36], [17, 40], [21, 40], [22, 38], [22, 39], [17, 35], [16, 40], [22, 40], [17, 41], [21, 41], [19, 34], [15, 38], [19, 42], [20, 42], [19, 43]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3 are at distance 1 or 1.41, such as [20, 38], [20, 37], and [18, 39]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [20, 38]."
35,17,movement,[10,30],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [10, 30] and [11, 31] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since both are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, the agent can choose either. Here, the agent moves to [10, 30]."
35,138,movement,[13,38],"The agent is currently at position [14, 39] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [13, 38] and [15, 38], both at distance 1.41. Moving to either of these positions will maximize welfare compared to the current position. Choosing [13, 38] as the target position as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar value."
35,37,movement,[36,9],"The agent is currently at position [35,9] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 3 is [36,9], which is at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,9] to maximize welfare."
35,157,movement,[17,36],"The agent is currently at position [18,36] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except a few with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [17,36] and [19,36]. Both are equally close and have the same sugar value. Choosing [17,36] as the target position to move to maximize welfare."
35,140,movement,[12,35],"The agent is currently at position [12, 36] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 within vision range, such as [12, 35], [13, 35], [13, 37], [14, 36], and others. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [12, 35] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [12, 35] to maximize welfare."
35,30,movement,[13,30],"Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value (2.0) are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [13,30] and [12,31]. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [13,30]."
35,8,movement,[31,9],"The agent is currently at position [31,10] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at multiple positions ([31,9], [32,10], [31,8], [29,12], [31,7], [34,10], [31,14]). The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [31,9] and [32,10]. Choosing the closest with maximum welfare, the agent will move to [31,9]."
35,122,movement,[10,42],"The agent is currently at position [11, 42] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, all have sugar values of 3.0 or less, except the current position which has 1.0. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. The closest such positions are at distance 1.0: [10, 42] and [11, 43]. Both are unoccupied and have sugar value 3.0. The agent will choose to move to [10, 42] as it is the first found nearest position with maximum welfare."
35,101,movement,[34,14],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available sugar in the visible area. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0: [34,14], [35,15], and [34,16]. Since the agent is currently at [34,15], moving to any of these positions yields the same maximum welfare. Choosing [34,14] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
35,156,movement,[39,9],"The agent is currently at position [39, 10] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available at unoccupied positions is 3.0. These positions include [39, 9], [40, 10], [38, 9], [40, 11], [37, 10], [41, 10], [39, 12], [41, 9], [41, 11], [40, 12], [41, 8], [37, 12], [41, 12], [39, 7], [42, 10], [39, 13], [42, 9], [42, 11], [38, 13], [40, 13]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The closest positions at distance 1.0 are [39, 9] and [40, 10]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar, the agent will move to [39, 9]."
35,146,movement,[26,3],"The agent can move to either position [26,3] or [27,4], both producing a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since both positions have equal sugar value and distance, the agent will move to [26,3] as it is the first in the list of visible positions with maximum welfare."
35,7,movement,[13,29],"Among the unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [13, 29] has the highest sugar value of 2.0. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to the current position and other neighbors, which have sugar values of 1.0."
35,75,movement,[28,2],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [28, 2] has the highest sugar value of 2.0. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake."
35,144,movement,[34,1],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see several positions with sugar value 2.0 within its vision range. Among these, positions [34,1], [33,2], [32,2], and [34,2] all have sugar value 2.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [34,1] and [33,2]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum welfare, the agent will move to [34,1]."

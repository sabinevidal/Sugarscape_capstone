35,108,movement,[34,6],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple unoccupied positions within this range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [34,6], [36,6], [38,9], [36,12], and [37,12]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [34,6] and [36,6], both at a distance of approximately 2.24. The agent chooses to move to [34,6] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value available and unoccupied."
35,150,movement,[36,6],"The agent is currently at position [36,5] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values ranging from 1 to 3. The position [36,6] has the highest sugar value of 3 and is unoccupied. It is also the nearest position with maximum welfare. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,6]."
36,137,movement,[14,37],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the position [14, 37] has the highest sugar value of 4.0, which is greater than the sugar at its current position (1.0). This position is also unoccupied and within the agent's vision. Therefore, moving to [14, 37] maximizes the agent's welfare."
36,7,movement,[12,29],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [12, 29] and [14, 29] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at the same distance (1.0) from the agent's current position. Choosing either position will maximize welfare. I select [12, 29] arbitrarily as the target position for movement."
36,96,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. However, the current position has sugar value 1.0, which is less than the maximum visible sugar value 3.0. But all positions with sugar value 3.0 are occupied or out of reach. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or more, but they are all occupied. Therefore, the agent cannot move to a better position producing maximum welfare. Hence, the agent should not move."
36,151,movement,[32,9],"The agent is currently at position [33,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except some with 2.0. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value, which is 3.0. The closest such positions are [32,9] at distance 1.41, [33,6] at distance 2.0, [33,10] at distance 2.0, [32,6] at distance 2.24, and [35,7] at distance 2.24. The nearest is [32,9] at distance 1.41, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
36,161,movement,[28,12],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0 to 5.1. Since all these positions have the same maximum sugar value of 3.0, the agent will move to the nearest one to maximize welfare. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [28,12] and [29,13]. The agent will choose [28,12] as it is the first found nearest position with maximum sugar value."
36,84,movement,[40,7],"The agent is currently at position [41,6] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.41 to 3.61. The closest such position is [40,7] at distance 1.41, which is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while minimizing movement distance."
36,14,movement,[16,31],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0. The nearest positions with maximum welfare (sugar value 2.0) are at distance 1.0. Among these, moving to position [16,31] is chosen arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and at minimum distance."
36,56,movement,[36,12],"The agent is currently at position [32, 13] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 5. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at position [36, 12]. This position is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake."
36,15,movement,[38,9],"The agent is currently at position [38,10] with sugar 32.5. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [38,9] and [37,12]. Both are unoccupied and within vision range. The closest position with maximum sugar is [38,9] at distance 1.0, which is nearer than [37,12] at distance 2.24. Therefore, the agent should move to [38,9] to maximize welfare."
36,105,movement,[18,39],"The agent is currently at position [17, 34]. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [18, 39] and [17, 40], but these are at distances 5.1 and 6.0 respectively. There are no occupied positions at these coordinates, so they are free to move to. The agent will move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value, which is [18, 39] at distance 5.1."
36,60,movement,[37,12],"The agent is currently at position [36, 13] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values ranging from 2 to 4. The position [37, 12] has the highest sugar value of 4 and is unoccupied. It is also the nearest position with maximum welfare. Therefore, the agent should move to [37, 12]."
36,143,movement,[14,33],"The agent is currently at position [15, 33] with sugar 31.5. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0, but all positions with sugar 3.0 are occupied or not reachable without moving through occupied positions. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [14, 33] and [15, 34], both at distance 1.0 and unoccupied. Moving to either would increase the agent's sugar intake compared to the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to one of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [14, 33] as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar value."
36,129,movement,[30,15],"The agent is currently at position [30,14] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are those with sugar 3. Among these, the nearest positions are [30,15], [29,13], and [31,13], all at distances around 1.41 or less. Choosing the closest one, [30,15], which is at distance 1 and has sugar 3, maximizes welfare and is unoccupied."
36,111,movement,[34,4],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the positions [34,4] and [36,4] have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are at the same distance (1.41). Moving to either would maximize welfare. Choosing [34,4] arbitrarily as the target."
36,101,movement,[33,15],"The agent is currently at position [34,14] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions have sugar values mostly 3 or 2, but many are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3 are [33,15] and [35,15], both at distance 1.41. Choosing [33,15] as it is equally good and closest. Moving there will maximize the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake."
36,136,movement,[35,2],"The agent can move to any of the visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. All these positions have a sugar value of 2.0, which is the maximum welfare available in the visible area. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [35,2] and [34,3]. The agent will choose to move to [35,2] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
36,148,movement,[16,43],"The agent is currently at position [14, 42] with sugar 28.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [16, 43], [17, 42], [17, 41], and [17, 40]. All these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest position with maximum sugar (4.0) is [16, 43] at a distance of 2.24. Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 43] to maximize welfare."

37,146,movement,[26,3],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, the positions [26,3], [27,4], and [26,5] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally close (distance 1), the agent can move to any of these to maximize welfare. Choosing [26,3] arbitrarily as the target position."
37,165,movement,[13,40],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.41 (positions [13,40] and [16,39]). Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [13,40]."
37,157,movement,[19,35],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0. Since all these positions are unoccupied, moving to any of them would maximize welfare. Choosing position [19,35] as it is directly north and at distance 1.0."
37,66,movement,[37,7],"The agent is currently at position [37,5] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values ranging from 2 to 3. The highest sugar value among unoccupied positions is 3, found at positions [39,5], [37,7], [37,8], [40,6], and [37,9]. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are [39,5] and [37,7], both at distance 2. The agent will choose the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [37,7]."
37,141,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the agent's current sugar of 31.0. Moving to any of these positions would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."
37,106,movement,[14,39],"The agent is currently at position [13, 39] with sugar 29.75. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0, but all these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. The closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 (e.g., [14, 39], [12, 38]). Moving to any of these positions will increase the agent's sugar intake compared to the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [14, 39]."
37,106,reproduction,[5],"Agent 106 is male, age 19, with sugar 30.75 which is above the minimum required 17.5 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 5, who is female, age 37, with sugar 87.0, and has empty nearby positions. Both agents have empty neighboring sites, satisfying the reproduction conditions. Since max_partners is 1, agent 5 is selected as the partner for reproduction."
37,130,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the agent's current sugar of 29.5. Moving to any of these positions would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should stay in its current position to maximize welfare."
37,142,movement,[29,8],"The agent is currently at position [29,5] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [31,4], [30,7], [29,8], [29,9], and [29,10]. However, positions [29,8], [29,9], and [29,10] are at distances 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 respectively, but [29,8] and [29,9] are unoccupied and closer than [29,10]. Among these, [29,8] is the nearest with maximum sugar value 3.0 and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [29,8]."
37,155,movement,[36,6],"The agent is currently at position [36,7] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 2, but all positions with sugar 3 are occupied by other agents. The nearest unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value available are those with sugar 2 at positions [36,6], [37,6], [34,7], [38,7], [34,6], [34,8], [39,7], [35,4], [33,8], [37,10], [39,9], [34,10], [38,10], [32,7], [35,3], [37,11], [39,4], [38,3], [32,5], [40,5]. Among these, the closest is [36,6] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,6] to maximize welfare by moving to the nearest position with the highest sugar value available and unoccupied."
37,118,movement,[9,43],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the sugar at some occupied neighboring positions. However, since the agent can only move to unoccupied positions, it chooses the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. Among these, the closest is at position [9,43] with a distance of 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare within the agent's vision and movement constraints."
37,127,movement,[35,9],"The agent is currently at position [35, 11] with sugar value 1. The agent can see multiple unoccupied positions within its vision range, all with sugar value 3, which is higher than its current position. Since all these positions have the same sugar value, the agent will move to the nearest one to maximize welfare. The nearest unoccupied position with sugar value 3 is [35, 9], at a distance of 2.0. Therefore, the agent will move to [35, 9]."
37,132,movement,[33,9],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision, the position [33,9] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. It is at distance 2, which is within the agent's vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other unoccupied positions with sugar values of 2 or 1."
37,102,movement,[17,43],"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0. Since positions [17,43], [18,44], and [17,45] are unoccupied and have maximum welfare (sugar value 3.0) at the nearest distance, the agent will move to one of these. Choosing [17,43] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
37,57,movement,[21,38],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [21,38], which is unoccupied and has sugar value 3.0, maximizing welfare and minimizing distance."
37,38,movement,[35,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 2.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [35,1] and [36,2]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [35,1] as it is the first found with max sugar and nearest distance."
37,50,movement,[11,43],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, for example [11,43] and [12,44]. Choosing to move to [11,43] as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar value."
37,136,movement,[34,2],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision, all have the same sugar value of 2.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [34,2], [36,2], and [35,3]. Choosing any of these will maximize welfare. I select [34,2] as the target position as it is the first in the list and equally optimal."
37,112,movement,[16,39],"The agent is currently at position [17, 40] with sugar 28.75. Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0 at [17, 40]. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.41 (e.g., [16, 39]). Therefore, the agent should move to the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value, which is [16, 39]."

28,134,movement,[31,5],"The agent is currently at position [32,6] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [31,5], [33,7], [32,8], [31,4], [30,5], [33,8], [34,8], [35,6], [32,9], [35,5], and [33,9], all with sugar value 3. Among these, the closest positions are [31,5] and [33,7] at a distance of approximately 1.41. The agent can move to either, but chooses [31,5] as it is the first found with maximum sugar value and minimum distance. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake."
28,101,movement,[37,12],"The agent is currently at position [38,10] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [37,12] and [36,13], both with sugar value 4. Among these, [37,12] is closer (distance 2.24) compared to [36,13] (distance 3.61). Therefore, the agent will move to [37,12] to maximize welfare while minimizing distance."
28,124,movement,[30,5],"The agent is currently at position [31,6] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but the closest among them is at position [30,5] with a distance of 1.41. Moving there maximizes welfare by moving to the highest sugar value within vision and is the nearest such position."
28,88,movement,[14,35],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The agent chooses the nearest position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [14,35] and [13,36]. The agent selects [14,35] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare."
28,60,movement,[36,13],"The agent is currently at position [35,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at position [36,13]. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision (distance 4.12). Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by moving to the position with the highest sugar value available within vision."
28,8,movement,[33,9],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. The agent chooses to move to position [33,9], which is unoccupied, has sugar value 3.0, and is at distance 1.0, the nearest maximum welfare position."
28,120,movement,[30,13],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Among these, position [30,13] is unoccupied and closest with sugar 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare."
28,7,movement,[12,29],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, the positions [12, 29], [14, 29], and [13, 30] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are at the same distance (1.0), the agent can move to any of these to maximize welfare. Choosing [12, 29] arbitrarily as the target position."
28,58,movement,[29,10],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at positions [29,10], [28,11], and [29,8]. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar are at distance 1.0 ([29,10] and [28,11]). The agent chooses to move to [29,10] as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare (highest sugar value) at the shortest distance."
28,55,movement,[35,5],"The agent is currently at position [36,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [35,5], [38,4], and [35,6]. All these positions are at distances 1.41, 2.0, and 2.24 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [35,5] at distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,5]."
28,87,movement,[13,30],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the positions [13,30], [14,31], and [13,32] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are at equal distance (1.0), the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [13,30] arbitrarily as the target position with maximum welfare."
28,144,movement,[33,1],"The agent can see several unoccupied positions within its vision range. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the sugar value of the current position (1.0). Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [33,1], [32,2], [34,2], and [33,3]. Since all have equal sugar and equal distance, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [33,1] arbitrarily as it is within vision and unoccupied."
28,93,movement,[31,4],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [31,4], [33,7], and [32,8]. Among these, [31,4] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [31,4]."
28,133,movement,[9,37],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0, which is the maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [9,37] and [9,38], both at distance 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The agent chooses to move to [9,37] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (sugar 3.0) and is unoccupied."
28,111,movement,[38,4],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see several unoccupied positions with sugar values. The maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [38,4], [39,5], and [38,6], all at distance 1. The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is any of these three. Choosing [38,4] as it is the first in the list with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
28,81,movement,[31,11],"All visible positions with higher sugar values are occupied. The unoccupied visible positions have a maximum sugar value of 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.41 (31,11) and 2.0 (30,14). The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is (31,11)."
28,127,movement,[33,12],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0, such as [33,12]. Moving to [33,12] maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake and is the nearest such position."
28,103,movement,[36,12],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [36,12] and [37,10]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [36,12]."
28,14,movement,[13,34],"Among the visible positions, several have the maximum sugar value of 3.0. These positions are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The nearest positions with maximum sugar are at distance 1.0: [13,34] and [12,35]. Since both have the same sugar value and distance, moving to either is optimal. Choosing [13,34] arbitrarily."
28,80,movement,[29,8],"The agent is currently at position [29,7]. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0. The nearest such positions with sugar value 3.0 are [29,8] at distance 1.0 and [32,8] at distance 3.16. Since [29,8] is closer and unoccupied, the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
28,113,movement,[31,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [31,1] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare based on sugar availability."
28,74,movement,[26,3],"All adjacent positions have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing position [26, 3] arbitrarily among the options."

34,101,movement,[34,15],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0, such as [34,15] and [33,16]. Among these, [34,15] is unoccupied and closest. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake."
34,71,movement,[18,35],"The agent is currently at position [19, 35] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are [18, 35] and [20, 35], both at distance 1.0 and unoccupied. The agent will move to one of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [18, 35] arbitrarily as it is equally good as [20, 35]."
34,74,movement,[29,2],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see two positions: its current position [28,2] with sugar 1.0 and the adjacent position [29,2] also with sugar 1.0. Both positions have the same sugar value, but the current position is already occupied by the agent. The adjacent position [29,2] is unoccupied and has the same sugar value, so moving there maximizes welfare within vision range."
34,60,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is significantly lower than the sugar values of occupied neighboring positions. Since all nearby high sugar positions are occupied, moving to any visible position would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."
34,135,movement,[33,3],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the position [33,3] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other available positions with lower sugar values."
34,144,movement,[33,1],"All visible unoccupied positions within vision have the same sugar value of 2.0. The agent will move to the nearest such position to maximize welfare. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [33,1] and [34,2]. The agent chooses to move to [33,1] as it is the first in the list and equally optimal."
34,119,movement,[39,6],"The agent is currently at position [40,5] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values mostly 2.0 or 3.0. The highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions within vision is 3.0 at positions such as [39,6], [41,6], [38,4], [41,7], etc. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.41: [39,6] and [41,6]. Choosing [39,6] as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar value. Moving there will maximize welfare."
34,66,movement,[37,7],"The agent is currently at position [38,6] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values are [37,7], [38,4], [37,8], [39,8], and [40,8], all with sugar value 3. Among these, [37,7] is the closest (distance 1.41) and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,7] to maximize welfare."
34,118,movement,[8,41],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [8,41] and [10,41]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [8,41] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
34,156,movement,[39,10],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [39,10] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
34,55,movement,[37,8],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. Among visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [37,8] and [34,9], both at a distance of 2.24. Since both have the same sugar and distance, the agent chooses the first found position [37,8]."
34,31,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [11, 37] with sugar 20.0. All adjacent positions with higher sugar values are occupied. The visible unoccupied positions all have sugar values of 3.0 or less, which is less than the current position's sugar. Therefore, moving would not increase welfare. The agent should stay in place."
34,102,movement,[15,44],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [15,44], [14,42], and [16,44]. However, [14,42] is occupied. Positions [15,44] and [16,44] are unoccupied and at distance 1.0. Choosing [15,44] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare at the nearest distance."
34,110,movement,[40,8],"The agent is currently at position [40,9] with sugar value 1.0. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [40,8], [41,9], and [40,10]. Since all have the same sugar value and distance, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [40,8] as the target position for movement."
34,129,movement,[29,14],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Among these positions, the closest ones with sugar value 3.0 are at distances approximately 1.41 and 2.0. The agent chooses to move to the closest position with maximum sugar value, which is at position [29,14], as it is unoccupied and provides the highest welfare."
34,80,movement,[29,10],"The agent is currently at position [28,9] with sugar 1.0. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied or out of reach. The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [29,10] at distance 1.41. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while being the closest such position."
34,80,reproduction,[12],"Agent 80 is female, age 35, with sugar 52, which is above the minimum required for reproduction (10). There is one eligible partner, agent 12, who is male, age 34, with sugar 18, and has empty nearby positions. Both agents have empty neighboring sites, satisfying the reproduction conditions. Since max_partners is 3 and only one eligible partner is available, agent 12 is selected for reproduction."
34,152,movement,[10,37],"The agent is currently at position [11, 38] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0 or 2.0, which is higher than the current position. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance approximately 1.41 (positions [10, 37], [10, 39], [12, 39]) and others slightly farther. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0, the agent should move to [10, 37]."
34,131,movement,[13,33],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see several positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [13,33], [16,33], and [14,35]. Among these, [13,33] is the closest with a distance of 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [13,33] to maximize welfare."
34,8,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is lower than the sugar values of the occupied neighboring positions. Since all positions with higher sugar values are occupied, the agent cannot move to a better position. Therefore, the agent will not move."
34,85,movement,[38,11],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, such as (38,11), (39,12), and (38,13). Among these, (38,11) is chosen as it is the closest and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare."
34,116,movement,[19,41],"The agent is currently at position [18, 41] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, but all these positions are at a distance of at least 1 and are unoccupied. Since the agent should move to the nearest position with maximum welfare (maximum sugar value), it will move to one of the positions with sugar value 3 and minimum distance. The closest such positions are at distance 1 (e.g., [19, 41]). Therefore, the agent will move to [19, 41]."
34,128,movement,[30,7],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [30,7] and [32,8]. Both are unoccupied and at distances 1.41 and 2.24 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [30,7]. Therefore, the agent should move to [30,7] to maximize welfare."
34,59,movement,[9,36],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, with the maximum sugar value being 3.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The closest position with maximum sugar (3.0) is at [9,36] with distance 1.0, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent moves to [9,36] to maximize welfare."

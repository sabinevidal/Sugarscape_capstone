11,30,movement,[11,39],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 except for two positions with sugar 2.0 and the current position with sugar 1.0. Among the positions with sugar 3.0, the nearest ones are at distance 1.0: [11,39] and [10,40]. Both are unoccupied and provide maximum welfare within vision. Choosing to move to [11,39] as it is directly south and equally beneficial."
11,60,movement,[36,8],"The agent is currently at position [33,8] with sugar 44. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [36,8] with sugar 4.0, which is unoccupied and within vision range. Other positions with sugar 3.0 are either farther or less sugar. Moving to [36,8] maximizes welfare by moving to the nearest position with the highest sugar value available."
11,54,movement,[16,43],"The agent is currently at position [15, 41] with sugar value 1. The agent can see multiple positions within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4 at position [16, 43]. This position is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake."
11,81,movement,[30,5],"The agent is currently at position [30,6] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0, but all these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0, which is at [30,5] or [29,6]. Choosing [30,5] as it is directly adjacent and has sugar 3.0."
11,17,movement,[10,36],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [10,36], [9,37], and [11,37] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar value and distance, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [10,36] arbitrarily among them."
11,74,movement,[31,1],"Among the unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [31,1], [33,1], and [32,2] all have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions is beneficial. Choosing [31,1] arbitrarily as the target position."
11,56,movement,[36,13],"The agent is currently at position [38, 12] with sugar 13. The nearest unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [36, 13] with sugar 4.0 and distance 2.24. Other nearby positions have sugar values of 3.0 or less. Moving to [36, 13] maximizes welfare as it has the highest sugar value within vision and is unoccupied."
11,46,movement,[14,36],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Among these, position [14,36] is unoccupied and closest with sugar 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare and is the nearest such position."
11,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have sugar value 0 except the current position which also has 0 sugar. There are no unoccupied positions with higher sugar value within vision. Therefore, the agent should not move."
11,57,movement,[10,40],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [10,40], [9,41], [10,42]. All these positions are unoccupied. Choosing the closest position with maximum welfare, I select [10,40]."
11,8,movement,[33,14],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, for example [33,14] and [34,15]. Choosing to move to [33,14] as it is the first encountered position with maximum sugar value and minimum distance."
11,37,movement,[37,5],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0. Choosing one of these positions, for example [37,5], to move to maximizes welfare and is unoccupied."
11,5,movement,[18,36],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. The position [18,36] is unoccupied and at distance 1.0, providing maximum welfare at the nearest distance. Therefore, the agent should move to [18,36]."
11,88,movement,[13,40],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.41, for example [13,40] and [13,42]. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [13,40]."
11,67,movement,[13,39],"The agent is currently at position [14, 39] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions all have sugar value 3, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1 or slightly more. The agent will move to the nearest unoccupied position with sugar value 3, which is [13, 39]."
11,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
11,40,movement,[19,38],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among the positions with sugar 3.0, the closest ones are at distance 1.0: [19,38], [18,39], [20,39]. These positions are unoccupied and provide maximum welfare within vision. Choosing [19,38] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
11,62,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is the maximum welfare available. The agent is currently at position [30, 38] which also has sugar value 1.0. Since moving to any other position with the same sugar value does not provide additional welfare and all such positions are at least 1 unit away, the agent will stay in its current position to avoid unnecessary movement."
11,73,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare equal to neighbors, the agent will not move."
11,59,movement,[16,38],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, but all positions with sugar 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0, which is at distance 1.0 at position [16,38]."
11,14,movement,[14,33],"Among the visible positions, the ones with the highest sugar value (3.0) are at distances 1.0, 1.41, and 2.0. The closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [14,33] and [14,34]. Both are unoccupied and within vision. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [14,33]."
11,27,movement,[29,1],"Among the unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [29,1] and [28,2] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is equally good. Choosing to move to [29,1]."
11,20,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
11,15,movement,[30,11],"The agent is currently at position [31,11] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3, but all these positions are unoccupied and at various distances. The nearest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. Among these, position [30,11] is at distance 1.0 and unoccupied, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
11,31,movement,[10,42],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0. The agent should move to the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. Among these, positions at distance 1.0 are closest and unoccupied: [10,42] and [11,43]. Either is equally good, so the agent will move to [10,42]."

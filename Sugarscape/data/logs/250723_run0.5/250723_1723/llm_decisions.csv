25,15,movement,[39,12],"The agent is currently at position [38,12] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but some of these positions are occupied. The unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 and closest distance are [39,12] at distance 1.0 and [39,11] and [39,13] at distance 1.41. Among these, [39,12] is the closest and unoccupied, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
25,116,movement,[16,40],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.41 (positions [16,40]) and 2.0 (position [15,39]). Among these, position [16,40] is the closest with maximum sugar. Therefore, the agent should move to position [16,40]."
25,30,movement,[12,33],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0 except the current position which has 1.0 and one adjacent position with 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar (2.0) are at distance 1.0: [12,33] and [11,34]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [12,33] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
25,37,movement,[37,8],"The agent is currently at position [37,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [37,8] and [36,9]. Both are unoccupied and have the highest sugar value visible. The agent will move to the closest one, [37,8], to maximize welfare."
25,136,movement,[34,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [34,2], [35,2], and [32,1] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [34,2] at distance 1.0, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
25,58,movement,[29,9],"The agent is currently at position [30,9] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values are [29,9] and [32,9] both with sugar value 3.0. Among these, [29,9] is closer (distance 1.0) compared to [32,9] (distance 2.0). The position [29,9] is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision range. Therefore, the agent should move to [29,9]."
25,96,movement,[9,36],"The agent is currently at position [10, 36] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0 at positions [9, 36], [9, 38], [10, 39], [9, 39], [13, 38], [10, 40], [11, 40], and [10, 41]. The nearest of these is [9, 36] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [9, 36] to maximize welfare."
25,57,movement,[11,40],"The agent is currently at position [12, 40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41, such as [11, 40] and [11, 41]. Since [11, 40] is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
25,7,movement,[15,29],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [15,29], [17,29], and [16,30] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar value and distance, moving to any of these maximizes welfare. Choosing [15,29] arbitrarily as the target."
25,50,movement,[14,43],"The agent is currently at position [14, 41] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0, but all these positions are unoccupied and at various distances. The closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 2.0 ([14, 43]) and 2.24 ([15, 39]). Among these, [14, 43] is the nearest position with maximum welfare (sugar value 3.0) and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 43]."
25,118,movement,[17,42],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0 and unoccupied: [17,42], [16,43], [18,43], and [17,44]. Choosing [17,42] as it is the first nearest position with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
25,110,movement,[37,13],"The agent is currently at position [37, 12] with sugar value 1.0. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 within its vision range. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 2.0. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [37, 13] at distance 1.0. Since this position is unoccupied and has the highest sugar value within vision, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
25,128,movement,[32,9],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. All positions with sugar 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distances 1.41 (positions [32,9]) and 2.0 (position [31,12]). The closest position with maximum sugar is [32,9]. Therefore, the agent should move to [32,9] to maximize welfare."
25,107,movement,[32,1],"The agent can see three nearby positions within its vision range: [32,1] with sugar 2.0, [33,1] (current position) with sugar 1.0, and [34,1] with sugar 1.0. Among these, [32,1] has the highest sugar value and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [32,1] to maximize its welfare."
25,42,movement,[29,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [29,1] and [28,3] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at distances 1 and 2 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [29,1]. Therefore, the agent should move to [29,1]."
25,117,movement,[34,9],"The agent is currently at position [35,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [34,9] and [36,9], both at distance 1.0. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar, the agent will move to [34,9]."
25,85,movement,[39,9],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [39,9], [40,10], and [39,11]. Choosing to move to [39,9] as it is the first nearest position with maximum welfare (sugar value) and unoccupied."
25,140,movement,[9,38],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances approximately 3.0 to 4.12 units away. The agent chooses to move to the nearest such position at [9, 38], which is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value available within vision."

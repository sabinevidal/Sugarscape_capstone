14,8,movement,[35,12],"The agent is currently at position [34,12] with sugar value 1. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3, which is the maximum welfare available nearby. Among these, the closest positions are [35,12] and [33,13] at distances 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [35,12]."
14,37,movement,[38,12],"The agent is currently at position [37,12] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions within vision have a sugar value of 3, which is the maximum available in visible unoccupied positions. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0: [38,12] and [37,13]. Both are unoccupied and equally close. The agent can move to either. Choosing [38,12] arbitrarily as the target position to maximize welfare and minimize distance."
14,55,movement,[33,3],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at positions [33,3], [33,5], [35,4], and [36,4]. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are [33,3] and [33,5], both at distance 1. The agent chooses to move to [33,3] as it is the first optimal position found with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
14,31,movement,[9,40],"The agent is currently at position [9, 41] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have a sugar value of 3. Since all these positions have the same maximum sugar value, the agent will move to the nearest one. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0: [9, 40] and [8, 41]. The agent chooses to move to [9, 40] as it is directly adjacent and provides maximum welfare."
14,53,movement,[38,8],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [38,8] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [38,8]."
14,71,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is equal to the sugar value at the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare (sugar value 1.0), there is no benefit in moving to another position."
14,57,movement,[11,42],"The agent is currently at position [12, 42] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values of 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0: [11, 42] and [12, 43]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [11, 42]."
14,93,movement,[30,6],"The agent is currently at position [30,7] with sugar value 1.0. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [30,6], [31,7], and [30,8]. Since all have the same sugar value and distance, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [30,6] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
14,66,movement,[35,4],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at positions [35,4], [36,3], [36,4], and [33,5]. Among these, [35,4] is the closest at a distance of 1.41. Therefore, the agent will move to [35,4]."
14,54,movement,[16,43],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [16,43]. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [16,43]."
14,52,movement,[33,13],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except a few with 2.0 or 1.0, and the current position has sugar value 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, such as [33,13] and [34,14]. Both are unoccupied and have the highest sugar value within vision. Choosing [33,13] as it is the closest and unoccupied."
14,50,movement,[14,43],"The agent is currently at position [14, 42] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 3 is [14, 43], which is at distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake."
15,60,movement,[36,7],"The agent is currently at position [33,7]. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are those with sugar_value 4.0 at positions [35,8], [35,9], [36,7], [36,8], [37,8], and [36,10]. Among these, the closest is [36,7] with a distance of 3.0. All these positions are unoccupied. Moving to [36,7] maximizes the agent's welfare by moving to a position with the highest sugar value within its vision range."
15,23,movement,[36,3],"The agent can move to any of the visible positions with sugar value 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest position with maximum sugar is at [36,3] with sugar 3.0 and distance 1.0, and it is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent will move to [36,3]."
15,57,movement,[13,41],"The agent is currently at position [11, 42] with sugar 26. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4.0 at positions [13, 41], [13, 40], [13, 39], and [14, 40]. Among these, [13, 41] is the closest (distance 2.24) and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while being the nearest such position."
15,71,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is equal to the current position's sugar value. Since the current position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare, there is no benefit in moving."
15,14,movement,[17,34],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [17,34], [16,34], and [18,34] have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. They are also the nearest positions with maximum welfare. Choosing to move to [17,34] as it is directly north and at distance 1.0, which is the closest among the maximum sugar positions."

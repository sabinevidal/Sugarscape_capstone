19,2,movement,[13,38],"The agent is currently at position [14, 36] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 4.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 4.0 are [16, 37] and [13, 38], both at a distance of approximately 2.24. Choosing the closest one, the agent will move to [13, 38]."
19,110,movement,[36,8],"The agent is currently at position [38,8] with sugar value 2. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 4, but many of the positions with sugar 4 are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 4 are [36,8], [36,7], [36,10], [35,8], and [38,11]. Among these, [36,8] is the closest at distance 2.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,8] to maximize welfare."
19,14,movement,[14,35],"Among the visible positions, several have the maximum sugar value of 3.0 and are at a distance of 1 or slightly more. The positions [14,35], [16,35], and [15,36] each have sugar value 3.0 and are at distance 1.0, and are unoccupied. Choosing any of these maximizes welfare and is nearest. I select [14,35] as the target position for movement."
19,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. There is no benefit in moving to any other position as they do not provide higher welfare."
19,72,movement,[33,12],"The agent is currently at position [33, 13]. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [33, 12], [36, 10], and [34, 8]. The closest of these is [33, 12] at a distance of 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [33, 12] to maximize welfare."
19,81,movement,[34,8],"The agent is currently at position [33,6] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 5. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [34,8], [35,8], and [36,7]. These positions are at distances 2.24, 2.83, and 3.16 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar value is [34,8] at distance 2.24. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,8] to maximize welfare."
19,74,movement,[29,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [29,1], [28,2], and [29,3] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent is currently at [29,2] with sugar value 1.0. Moving to any of these positions will increase welfare. Choosing [29,1] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar value."
19,74,reproduction,[75],"Agent 74 is male, age 20, with sugar 32.5 which is above the minimum required 25.0 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 75, who is female, age 19, with sugar 27.5, also above the minimum. Both have empty neighboring positions available (agent 74 has [29,50] and [29,2], agent 75 has [30,50] and [31,1]), satisfying the condition for reproduction. Since max_partners is 1, agent 75 is selected as the partner for reproduction."
19,84,movement,[35,8],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [35,8], [36,7], and [36,10]. Among these, [35,8] is the closest at a distance of 2.0. Therefore, the agent will move to [35,8]."
19,84,reproduction,[8],"Agent 84 is female, age 20, with sugar 14.0 which is above the minimum required 9.0 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 8, who is male, age 19, with sugar 21.0. Both agents have empty neighboring positions (agent 84 has [35,7], partner 8 has [34,9],[36,9],[35,10]), satisfying the reproduction conditions. Since max_partners is 1, agent 8 is selected as the partner for reproduction."
19,24,movement,[16,40],"The agent is currently at position [16, 41] with sugar 22. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4.0 at multiple locations: [16, 40], [14, 40], [18, 40], and [15, 43]. Among these, [16, 40] is the closest (distance 1.0) and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 40] to maximize welfare."
19,12,movement,[36,7],"The agent is currently at position [36,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [36,7] and [36,10]. The nearest of these is [36,7] at distance 3.0, which is within the agent's vision of 6. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake."
19,58,movement,[31,9],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The agent will move to the nearest such position to maximize welfare. Positions at distance 1.0 with sugar 3.0 are available, so the agent moves to one of them, for example [31,9]."
19,58,reproduction,[60],"Agent 58 is male, age 20, with sugar 52, which is above the minimum sugar required for reproduction (6). There is one eligible partner, agent 60, who is female, age 19, with sugar 45, and has empty nearby positions. Both agents have empty neighboring sites, satisfying the reproduction conditions. Since max_partners is 4 and only one eligible partner is available, agent 60 is selected for reproduction."
19,104,movement,[14,33],"The agent is currently at position [13,33] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 to 3.61. The closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [14,33] and [12,34], both at distance 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. Both positions are unoccupied. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [14,33]."
19,96,movement,[13,39],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at position [13, 39], but it is at distance 5.0. There are closer positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0 (positions [12, 34], [13, 35], and [12, 35]). Since the rule prioritizes maximum welfare first, the agent should move to the position with sugar 4.0 at [13, 39], despite it being farther than the positions with sugar 3.0. The position [13, 39] is unoccupied and within vision range, so the agent will move there."
19,96,reproduction,[2],"Agent 96 is female, age 20, with sugar 33.5 which is above the minimum required 13.0 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 2, who is male, age 20, with sugar 54.0. Both have empty neighboring positions available (agent 96 has [12,39],[13,40] and agent 2 has [13,37],[12,38],[14,38]). Since the partner is within vision range and fertile, and at least one of them has an empty adjacent site, reproduction is possible. Agent 96 can reproduce with up to 2 partners but only one eligible partner is available. Therefore, agent 2 is selected for reproduction."
19,11,movement,[34,3],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see several positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [34,3] and [35,5]. Both are unoccupied and at distances 1 and 2 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [34,3]. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,3]."
19,102,movement,[15,43],"The agent is currently at position [16, 43] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [15, 43], [14, 40], [18, 40], [16, 38], and [16, 37]. The closest of these is [15, 43] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 43] to maximize welfare."
19,5,movement,[16,38],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0. The closest positions with sugar 4.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The position [16,38] has sugar 4.0 and is at distance 1.0, which is the nearest position with maximum welfare. Therefore, the agent should move to [16,38]."
19,46,movement,[18,40],"The agent is currently at position [17, 41] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [18, 40], [14, 40], and [16, 37]. Of these, [18, 40] is the closest (distance 1.41) and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [18, 40] to maximize welfare."
19,26,movement,[39,5],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [39,5] and [40,6] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at distance 1.0, so the agent can move to either. Choosing [39,5] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
19,37,movement,[38,11],"The agent is currently at position [39,9] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions within a distance of 6. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [38,11] and [36,10]. Both are at distances 2.24 and 3.16 respectively. The nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar) is [38,11] with sugar 4.0 and distance 2.24. Therefore, the agent should move to [38,11]."
19,37,reproduction,[85],"Agent 37 is female, age 20, with sugar 13.5 which is above the minimum required for reproduction (5.0). There is one eligible partner, agent 85, who is male, age 19, with sugar 13.0. Both have empty neighboring positions available for placing a child. Since the max partners is 2 and only one eligible partner is present, agent 85 is selected for reproduction. This ensures reproduction occurs successfully with available resources and space."

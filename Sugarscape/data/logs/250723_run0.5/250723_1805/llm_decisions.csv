The closest position with maximum sugar is [11, 41]. Therefore, the agent should move to [11, 41]."
34,122,movement,[11,42],"The agent is currently at position [12, 42] with a sugar value of 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The closest such position is [11, 42] at distance 1.0, which is unoccupied.

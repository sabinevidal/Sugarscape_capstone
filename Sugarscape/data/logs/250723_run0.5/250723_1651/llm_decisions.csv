17,100,movement,[18,42],"The agent is currently at position [17, 42] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [18, 42] and [17, 43]. The agent can move to either of these positions. Choosing [18, 42] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
17,59,movement,[18,38],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [18,38] and [19,39]. Choosing [18,38] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
17,24,movement,[16,41],"The agent is currently at position [17, 40] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [16, 41] and [18, 41], both at a distance of approximately 1.41. Choosing [16, 41] as it is the closest and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare within vision range."
17,24,reproduction,[46],"Agent 24 is female, age 18, with sugar 44, which is above the minimum sugar required for reproduction (14). The eligible partner is agent 46, male, age 18, with sugar 48. Both have empty neighboring positions (agent 24 has three empty nearby positions and agent 46 has two). Since the partner is within vision range, fertile, of opposite sex, and at least one of them has an empty neighboring site, reproduction is possible. Agent 24 can reproduce with agent 46, and since max_partners is 2 but only one eligible partner is available, only agent 46 is chosen."
17,55,movement,[33,3],"The agent is currently at position [33,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Positions with sugar value 3.0 are [33,3], [32,4], [34,4], [32,5], [31,4], [35,4], [33,6], [32,6], [34,6], and [33,7]. However, positions [34,3] and [34,5] are occupied, so [34,4] and [34,6] are unoccupied and have sugar 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [33,3], [32,4], and [34,4]. Among these, [33,3] and [32,4] are unoccupied and have sugar 3.0. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [33,3] at distance 1.0 and unoccupied."
17,84,movement,[32,11],"The agent is currently at position [32, 10] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 5. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4, found at positions [32, 11] and [34, 13]. The closest of these is [32, 11] at distance 1. Moving there maximizes welfare and is the nearest such position."
17,85,movement,[38,8],"The agent is currently at position [37,7] with sugar value 1. The visible positions all have sugar values of 3 or less, with the maximum sugar value of 3 available at multiple positions. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are at distances 1.41 to 2.83. The closest position with sugar value 3 is [38,8] at distance 1.41, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [38,8] to maximize welfare."
17,71,movement,[24,33],"The agent is currently at position [27, 32] with a sugar value of 1.0. Within its vision range, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 2.0 at positions [24, 33] and [23, 32]. Among these, [24, 33] is closer (distance 3.16) compared to [23, 32] (distance 4.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [24, 33] to maximize its welfare."
17,72,movement,[34,13],"The agent is currently at position [37,13] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with higher sugar values are [34,13] with 4 sugar and unoccupied. Other positions with sugar 3 are closer but less than 4. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,13] to maximize welfare."
17,87,movement,[18,34],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [18, 34] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare as per the movement rule."
17,93,movement,[30,6],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [30,6] and [29,7]. Choosing to move to [30,6] as it is the first encountered position with maximum welfare at minimum distance."
17,74,movement,[29,1],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [29,1] and [28,2] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is equally good. Choosing to move to [29,1]."
17,17,movement,[10,30],"All adjacent positions have the same sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing to move to position [10, 30] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value."
17,54,movement,[15,41],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0 sugar. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The position [15, 41] is unoccupied, has sugar 3.0, and is at distance 1.0, which is the nearest maximum welfare position. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 41]."
17,31,movement,[11,41],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [11, 41] and [11, 42]. Choosing the closest position [11, 41] to maximize welfare and minimize movement cost."
17,11,movement,[34,4],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [34,4] and [35,4] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are unoccupied and at distances 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The nearest position with maximum welfare is [34,4]. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,4]."
17,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
17,95,movement,[40,11],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [40,11]. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare. Therefore, the agent should move to [40,11]."
17,52,movement,[34,11],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible range. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0: [34,11] and [32,12]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [34,11] as it is directly adjacent and equally beneficial."
17,52,reproduction,[80],"Agent 52 is male, age 18, with sugar 49, which is above the minimum sugar required for reproduction (8). There is one eligible partner, agent 80, who is female, age 18, with sugar 51, and has empty nearby positions. Both agents have empty neighboring sites, satisfying the reproduction conditions. Since max_partners is 3 and only one eligible partner is available, agent 80 is selected for reproduction."
17,26,movement,[39,4],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the positions [39,4], [39,6], [40,6], and [39,7] have the highest sugar value of 3.0.

17,75,movement,[31,1],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see three nearby positions: [31,1] with sugar 2.0, [30,2] with sugar 2.0, and its current position [30,1] with sugar 1.0. Both [31,1] and [30,2] have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent should move to one of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [31,1] as it is the first in the visible positions list with maximum sugar and is unoccupied."
17,27,movement,[28,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [28, 2] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake."

27,104,movement,[17,36],"The agent is currently at position [17,34] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [18,34] (distance 1.0), [16,33] (distance 1.41), [17,36] (distance 2.0), and [15,35] (distance 2.24). However, positions [18,34] and [16,33] are occupied, so they are not available for movement. The next nearest position with sugar 3.0 and unoccupied is [17,36] at distance 2.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [17,36] to maximize welfare."
27,115,movement,[30,11],"The agent is currently at position [30, 10] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 2 or 3, but many are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value (3) are at [30, 11], [30, 13], [30, 14], [29, 14], [31, 14], [30, 15], and [31, 15]. Among these, [30, 11] is the closest at distance 1.0 and has sugar value 3. Therefore, the agent should move to [30, 11] to maximize welfare."
27,74,movement,[27,3],"Among the visible positions, the position [27,3] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there will maximize welfare based on sugar availability within the agent's vision range."
27,24,movement,[13,43],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0 from the agent's current position (13,44). Choosing to move to (13,43) as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
27,123,movement,[29,3],"The agent can see two positions within its vision: its current position [29,2] with sugar value 1.0 and an adjacent position [29,3] with sugar value 2.0. The position [29,3] is unoccupied and has a higher sugar value, so moving there maximizes welfare."
27,11,movement,[32,3],"The agent can move to positions [32,3], [31,3], or [34,2], each with a sugar value of 2.0, which is the maximum welfare available in visible unoccupied positions. Among these, [32,3] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent will move to [32,3]."
27,113,movement,[30,1],"The agent is currently at position [31,1] with sugar value 1. Among the visible positions within vision range, [30,1] has the highest sugar value of 2 and is unoccupied. Therefore, moving to [30,1] maximizes welfare."
27,85,movement,[40,8],"The agent is currently at position [40,9] with sugar value 1.0. All visible positions have sugar value 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [40,8] and [41,9]. However, [41,9] is occupied by another agent (id 109). Therefore, the best unoccupied position with maximum welfare and nearest distance is [40,8]. The agent should move there to maximize sugar intake."
27,117,movement,[37,9],"The agent is currently at position [34,10] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at multiple positions: [37,9], [37,11], [37,12], [36,13], [34,14], [35,6], [33,14], [35,14], [38,8], [38,12], [36,14], [34,15], [33,5], [33,15], [35,15]. The nearest of these is at distance 3.16 (positions [37,9] and [37,11]). Since these positions are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value visible, the agent should move to one of these. Choosing [37,9] as the target position for movement."
27,87,movement,[13,31],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [13,31], [14,32], and [13,33] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions is equally beneficial. Choosing to move to [13,31] arbitrarily to maximize welfare."
27,112,movement,[15,41],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.41: [15,41] and [17,41]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [15,41] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
27,53,movement,[38,8],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically at [38,8]. This position is unoccupied and thus the best move for maximizing welfare."
27,96,movement,[8,39],"The agent is currently at position [8,38] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are several positions with sugar value 3.0 within vision range: [8,39], [8,40], [10,39], [11,39], [8,42], [12,37], and [9,42]. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [8,39] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [8,39] to maximize welfare."
27,30,movement,[12,31],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0, so moving to any of these positions will maximize welfare. Choosing position [12,31] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
27,135,movement,[33,4],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the positions at [33,4] and [33,5] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Among these, [33,4] is closer (distance 1.0) compared to [33,5] (distance 2.0). Therefore, the agent moves to [33,4] to maximize welfare while minimizing movement distance."
28,142,movement,[29,9],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [29,9] and [31,9]. Choosing [29,9] as the target position to move to."
28,125,movement,[13,40],"The agent is currently at position [13, 39] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 4.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 4.0 at distances 1.0 to 5.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 4.0 are [13, 40], [12, 40], [15, 40], and [14, 41]. Among these, the closest is [13, 40] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [13, 40] to maximize welfare while minimizing movement distance."
28,115,movement,[29,11],"The agent is currently at position [30, 11] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have sugar value 3.0, which is higher than the current position. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [29, 11] and [31, 11]. Both are unoccupied and have the maximum welfare (sugar value) available nearby. The agent will move to the closest such position, choosing [29, 11] as it is the first in the list of nearest maximum welfare positions."
28,5,movement,[18,39],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The maximum sugar value available in these positions is 4.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 4.0 are at distances 1.41 and 2.24. The nearest position with maximum sugar (4.0) is at [18,39] with distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent moves to [18,39]."
28,128,movement,[31,9],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are not occupied. The maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at positions [31,9], [31,11], [32,9], [29,10], [32,8], and [33,9]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [31,9] and [31,11], both at distance 1. The agent chooses to move to [31,9] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar) and is unoccupied."
28,112,movement,[15,40],"The agent is currently at position [15, 41] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 4.0 at positions [15, 40], [14, 41], [17, 41], and [17, 39]. The nearest positions with sugar 4.0 are [15, 40] and [14, 41], both at distance 1.0. Choosing [15, 40] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare within vision range."
28,24,movement,[14,41],"The agent is currently at position [13, 43] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions within a radius of 6. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 4.0, found at positions [14, 41], [12, 40], and [17, 41]. The closest of these is [14, 41] with a distance of approximately 2.24. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 41] to maximize its welfare."

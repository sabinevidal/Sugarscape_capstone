7,81,movement,[29,7],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or less. The agent is currently at position [29,8] with sugar 1.0. Moving to any of the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 will maximize welfare. The closest such positions are at distance 1.0: [29,7], [28,8], and [30,8]. Choosing [29,7] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
7,24,movement,[16,41],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [16,41], [16,42], and [16,43]. Among these, [16,41] is the closest at a distance of 2.0. Therefore, the agent will move to position [16,41]."
7,82,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent will stay in place."
7,34,movement,[9,31],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [9,31] and [8,32] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is equally good. Choosing to move to [9,31]."
7,96,movement,[12,40],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 4.0, found at positions [12,40], [16,42], and [16,43]. Among these, [12,40] is the closest at a distance of 2.0. Therefore, the agent moves to [12,40] to maximize its welfare by collecting the highest sugar nearby."
7,54,movement,[16,42],"The agent is currently at position [15, 39] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are [16, 42] and [16, 43], both with sugar value 4. Among these, [16, 42] is closer (distance 3.16) compared to [16, 43] (distance 4.12). The position [16, 42] is unoccupied, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
7,66,movement,[36,5],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0 is at [36,5], which is unoccupied and within vision. Moving there maximizes welfare."
7,2,movement,[12,37],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The position [12,37] is unoccupied and has sugar 3.0 at distance 1.0, which is the nearest maximum welfare position. Therefore, the agent should move to [12,37]."
7,50,movement,[16,43],"The agent is currently at position [16,40] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [16,43] with sugar 4, which is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare as it has the highest sugar value and is reachable."
7,95,movement,[31,8],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [31,8] and [30,9]. Choosing [31,8] as it is directly adjacent and closer in terms of coordinates."
7,38,movement,[38,11],"Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value (3.0) are at distance 1 or approximately 1.41. Since the rule is to move to the nearest position with maximum welfare, the agent should move to one of the positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0. The positions [38,11] and [39,12] both have sugar value 3.0 and distance 1.0. Choosing [38,11] as it is directly north and equally optimal."
7,23,movement,[34,3],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [34,3] and [36,3]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [34,3] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
7,49,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have zero sugar value, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying in place conserves energy and avoids unnecessary movement."
7,30,movement,[11,40],"The agent is currently at position [11, 41] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have sugar values of 3.0 except for two with 2.0 and one with 1.0. The agent should move to one of the positions with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. The closest such positions are at distance 1.0: [11, 40] and [11, 42]. Either is equally good, so the agent will move to [11, 40]."
7,19,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. There is no benefit in moving to any other position as they do not provide higher welfare."
7,4,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
7,73,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any increase in sugar value, the agent will stay in its current position to avoid unnecessary movement."

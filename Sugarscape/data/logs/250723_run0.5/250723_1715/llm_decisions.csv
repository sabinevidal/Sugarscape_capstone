23,102,movement,[13,43],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0. The agent is currently at position [13,44] with sugar value 1.0. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, such as [13,43], [12,44], [13,45], [12,43], [12,45], and [14,45]. Among these, the agent can move to any as they are unoccupied and have the highest sugar value within vision. Choosing [13,43] as it is directly adjacent and has maximum sugar value 3.0."
23,42,movement,[29,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [29,1] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to staying at the current position with sugar value 1.0."
23,85,movement,[38,10],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0 (position [38,10]). Therefore, the agent moves to position [38,10] to maximize welfare while minimizing distance."
23,38,movement,[33,2],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 2.0, which is less than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. However, the current position has sugar value 1.0, which is less than the visible positions. But all positions with higher sugar are occupied. Therefore, the agent moves to the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 2.0. Among these, positions at distance 1.41 are closest. The agent chooses position [33,2] as it is unoccupied and has maximum sugar value within vision."
23,38,reproduction,[11],"Agent 38 is female, age 24, with sugar 30, which is above the minimum sugar required for reproduction (17). There is one eligible partner, agent 11, who is male, age 23, with sugar 26. Both agents have empty neighboring positions (agent 38 has [33,1] and [32,2]; agent 11 has [32,3], [34,3], and [33,4]). Since the partner is within vision range and fertile, and at least one of them has an empty adjacent site, reproduction is possible. Agent 38 can reproduce with up to 1 partner, so agent 11 is selected for reproduction."
23,132,movement,[35,1],"Among the visible positions, several have the maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are at a distance of 1 or 1.41. Since all these positions are unoccupied, the agent can move to any of them. Choosing position [35,1] as it is the nearest with maximum sugar value."
23,11,movement,[32,3],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, positions [32,3], [33,4], [32,2], and [32,4] are unoccupied and at distance 1 or 1.41, so the nearest maximum welfare positions are these. Choosing [32,3] as it is the closest with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
23,93,movement,[30,4],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [30,4], [29,5], and [30,6]. All these positions are unoccupied. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar welfare, I select [30,4]."
23,8,movement,[34,7],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [34,7], [35,7], [34,6], [35,10], and [34,11]. Among these, the closest positions are [34,7] and [35,7] at distance 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The agent chooses to move to [34,7] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value available."
23,129,movement,[28,8],"The agent is currently at position [30,7] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with higher sugar values are at [28,8], [30,10], and [29,10], each with sugar value 3. Among these, [28,8] is the closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value within vision range. Therefore, the agent should move to [28,8] to maximize welfare."
23,101,movement,[35,7],"The agent is currently at position [37,8]. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0. There are multiple such positions at sugar value 3.0, but the nearest one is at distance 2.24 at position [35,7]. This position is unoccupied and provides the maximum welfare (sugar) available within vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,7]."
23,57,movement,[8,39],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The maximum sugar value available in visible positions is 3.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [8,39] and [8,40]. The agent chooses to move to [8,39] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (sugar)."
23,125,movement,[12,38],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distances 1.0 to 2.83. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [12,38] at distance 1.0, [14,37] and [12,39] at distance 1.41. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar, the agent should move to [12,38]."
23,55,movement,[31,3],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 2.0 except the current position and some farther ones with 1.0. Among the positions with sugar value 2.0, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0: [31,3], [32,4], and [30,3]. Since all have the same sugar value and distance, moving to any of these is equally beneficial. Choosing [31,3] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
23,5,movement,[14,37],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are not occupied. All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is low compared to the agent's current sugar level. The agent chooses to move to the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value, which is 3.0. Among these, the closest position is [14, 37] at a distance of 1.41. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake while staying close."
23,12,movement,[34,6],"The agent is currently at position [34,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [34,6] and [37,5]. Both are at distances 2.0 and 3.16 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [34,6]. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,6] to maximize welfare."
23,81,movement,[30,10],"The agent is currently at position [32,9] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions have sugar values mostly 2 or 3, but many are occupied. The highest sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [30,10], [30,11], [34,11], [32,12], [29,10], [35,10], [31,12], [29,11], [30,12], [28,10], [31,13], and [32,14]. Among these, the closest with sugar 3.0 is [30,10] at distance 2.24. Therefore, the agent should move to [30,10] to maximize welfare."
23,75,movement,[30,2],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see three positions: its current position [29,2] with sugar 1.0, and two adjacent positions [30,2] and [29,3] each with sugar 2.0. Both adjacent positions are unoccupied. Since the movement rule is to move to the nearest position producing maximum welfare, the agent should move to either [30,2] or [29,3]. Both have equal sugar value and distance, so moving to [30,2] is chosen arbitrarily."
23,113,movement,null,"The agent can see positions [30,1] with sugar 1.0 (current position) and [31,1] with sugar 1.0, both unoccupied. Since the current position has the same sugar value and is already occupied by the agent, moving is not necessary. No better position with higher sugar is visible within vision range."

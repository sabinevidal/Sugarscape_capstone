18,88,movement,[13,41],"All visible positions have a maximum sugar value of 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.41, such as (13,41), (13,43), and (15,43). Among these, (13,41) is chosen as it is the closest and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare within vision range."
18,75,movement,[30,1],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [30,1], [32,1], and [31,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. All are at equal distance (1 unit) from the agent's current position. The agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [30,1] arbitrarily among these equally optimal options."
18,75,reproduction,[74],"Agent 75 is female, age 19, with sugar 36, which is above the minimum sugar required for reproduction (17). The only eligible partner is agent 74, a male aged 18 with sugar 43. Both have empty neighboring sites available for placing offspring. Since agent 75 can reproduce with up to 2 partners and only one eligible partner is present, reproduction with agent 74 is chosen. This ensures continuation of lineage and efficient use of available resources and space."
18,52,movement,[36,12],"The agent is currently at position [34, 11] with sugar 45. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [36, 12] and [37, 11]. Both are at distances 2.24 and 3.0 respectively. The nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar) is [36, 12]. Therefore, the agent should move to [36, 12]."
18,52,reproduction,[15],"Agent 52 is male, age 19, with sugar 48, which is above the minimum sugar required for reproduction (8). There is one eligible partner, agent 15, who is female, age 18, with sugar 27, and has empty nearby positions. Agent 52 also has an empty nearby position. Both agents meet the fertility and vision criteria. Since both have empty adjacent sites and the agent has enough sugar, reproduction is possible. Only one partner is available, so agent 15 is selected for reproduction."
18,13,movement,[17,38],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [17,38], [16,38], [16,40], and [18,40]. All these positions are unoccupied. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [17,38]."
18,23,movement,[36,3],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision, the positions [36,3] and [36,4] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are at distances 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [36,3]. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,3] to maximize welfare."
18,102,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [16,43] with a sugar value of 4.0. All adjacent positions within vision have sugar values of 3.0 or less and are unoccupied. Since the current position has the highest sugar value available within vision and is unoccupied, the agent should not move to avoid losing welfare."
18,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
18,85,movement,[37,11],"The agent is currently at position [38,8] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 4, but many are occupied. The nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value is [37,11] with sugar value 4 and distance approximately 3.16. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while being reachable within vision and unoccupied."
18,72,movement,[33,13],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [33,13] and [34,14]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [33,13] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
18,30,movement,[10,35],"Among the visible positions, several have the maximum sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [10,35], [11,36], and [10,37]. Choosing [10,35] as it is one of the closest and has maximum sugar value, and is unoccupied."
18,100,movement,[19,42],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum welfare, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, the agent selects position [19, 42] as it is the closest and unoccupied."
18,15,movement,[36,13],"The agent is currently at position [35, 12] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3, but some of these positions are occupied. The unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 are [36, 13], [33, 12], [35, 14], [36, 10], [34, 14], [36, 14], [33, 14], [37, 14], [35, 9], [32, 12], [38, 12], [35, 15], [38, 11], [32, 13], [38, 13], [34, 15], [36, 15], [35, 8], [31, 12], [39, 12], [35, 16]. Among these, the closest positions are [36, 13] at distance 1.41 and [35, 14] at distance 2. The closest position with maximum sugar is [36, 13]. Therefore, the agent should move to [36, 13]."
18,15,reproduction,[52],"Agent 15 is female and has one eligible partner, agent 52, who is male, within vision range, fertile, and has an empty neighboring site. Agent 15 also has multiple empty neighboring sites. Both agents meet the sugar requirement for reproduction (agent 15 has 25.5 sugar, agent 52 has 44 sugar, both above the minimum of 5). Since agent 15 can reproduce with up to 3 partners and only one eligible partner is available, reproduction with agent 52 is chosen. This will allow the creation of offspring with shared sugar resources and maintain population growth."
18,8,movement,[35,9],"The agent is currently at position [34, 10] with sugar value 1. There are multiple visible positions with sugar value 3 that are unoccupied and within vision range. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are at distances approximately 1.41 to 2.83. The closest position with maximum sugar value 3 is at [35, 9] with distance 1.41. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while being the nearest such position."
18,67,movement,[11,39],"The agent is currently at position [11, 40] with sugar value 1.0. All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, but the agent should move to an unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision. The positions with sugar value 3.0 are all unoccupied and at distances ranging from 1 to 5. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1, specifically [11, 39], [10, 40], and [10, 41]. Among these, any can be chosen as they have equal sugar and distance. The agent will move to [11, 39]."
18,2,movement,[14,36],"The agent is currently at position [14, 37] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have sugar value 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. The closest such positions are at distance 1.0: [14, 36] and [13, 37]. Choosing [14, 36] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
18,42,movement,[27,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Any of the positions at distance 1.0 with sugar 2.0 are equally good. The agent selects position [27,2] as it is the closest and unoccupied."

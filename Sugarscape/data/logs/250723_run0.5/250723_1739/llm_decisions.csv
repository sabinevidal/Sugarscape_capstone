29,124,movement,[29,6],"The agent is currently at position [30,5] with a sugar value of 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. These positions are [29,6], [32,5], [28,8], [34,6], [34,7], [28,9], [30,10], [35,4], and [35,6]. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [29,6] at distance 1.41 and [32,5] at distance 2.0. The agent chooses to move to [29,6] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value available."
29,134,movement,[32,5],"The agent is currently at position [31,5] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values mostly 2 or 3. The positions [32,5] and [34,6] have the highest sugar value of 3 and are unoccupied. Among these, [32,5] is closer (distance 1) compared to [34,6] (distance 3.16). Therefore, the agent should move to [32,5] to maximize welfare by moving to the nearest position with the highest sugar value available."
29,125,movement,[13,38],"The agent is currently at position [13, 40] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 2.0 or more. Among these, position [13, 38] is unoccupied and has sugar value 3.0 at distance 2.0, which is the nearest maximum welfare position available. Therefore, the agent should move to [13, 38]."
29,75,movement,[27,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [27,3] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare based on sugar availability."
29,17,movement,[10,30],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [10, 30] and [11, 31] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since both are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, moving to [10, 30] is chosen arbitrarily as it is to the left, maintaining variety in movement."
29,109,movement,[41,8],"The agent is currently at position [41,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [41,8], [40,9], and [42,9]. Choosing any of these positions will maximize welfare. I select [41,8] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
29,46,movement,[13,37],"The agent is currently at position [14, 37] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. The closest such positions are at distance 1.0 or 1.41, for example [13, 37] or [13, 36]. Choosing [13, 37] as it is the closest with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
29,15,movement,[38,9],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0, but all positions with 3.0 sugar are unoccupied and within vision. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [38,9] and [40,9]. Choosing [38,9] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
29,138,movement,[15,39],"The agent is currently at position [15, 38] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0, but the nearest one is at distance 1.0 at position [15, 39]. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 39] to maximize welfare."
29,11,movement,[33,2],"The agent evaluates all unoccupied visible positions within its vision range for maximum sugar value. The positions [33,2], [32,3], [31,3], and [32,4] all have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [33,2] and [32,3]. The agent chooses to move to [33,2] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar and is unoccupied."
29,121,movement,[31,15],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible range. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. The closest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar are [31,15], [32,13], and [30,15]. Choosing [31,15] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare with minimal movement cost."
29,130,movement,[18,40],"The agent is currently at position [17, 39] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3.0, but all these positions are unoccupied and at various distances. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.41 ([18, 40]), 2.0 ([17, 37]), 2.24 ([16, 37]), and [18, 37]. Among these, the closest is [18, 40] at distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [18, 40] to maximize welfare."
29,37,movement,[37,6],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum welfare are at distance 1.0: (37,6) and (38,7). Choosing (37,6) as it is directly adjacent and closer in terms of coordinates."
29,56,movement,[32,13],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [32,13] and [33,14]. Moving to either will maximize welfare by increasing sugar intake. Choosing [32,13] as it is the first found at minimum distance with maximum sugar."
29,90,movement,[16,42],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [16,42]. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [16,42]."
29,112,movement,[16,37],"The agent is currently at position [15, 40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0, but the closest ones are at distance 3.16, such as [16, 37] and [16, 43]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value maximizes welfare. Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 37]."
29,131,movement,[15,33],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [15,33] and [17,33], both at distance 1.0. Position [17,34] is occupied, so cannot move there. Therefore, the agent should move to either [15,33] or [17,33]. Choosing [15,33] arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare at minimum distance."
29,58,movement,[30,10],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are not occupied. All unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The agent chooses to move to position [30,10], which has sugar 3.0 and is at distance 1.0, the nearest maximum welfare position."
29,137,movement,[13,35],"All visible positions with the highest sugar value (3.0) are at a distance of 2.0 or more, and none of these positions are occupied. The agent should move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 2.0. Among these, the position [13, 35] is the closest and unoccupied, so the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
29,26,movement,[39,5],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [39,5], [39,4], [39,6], and [41,6] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. All these positions are unoccupied.

29,81,movement,[31,12],"The agent is currently at position [31,11] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values mostly 3 or 2. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are at distances 1.0 to 3.61. The closest unoccupied position with sugar 3 is at [31,12] with distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare and is the nearest such position."
29,111,movement,[39,4],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value available in visible and unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [39,4] and [38,6]. Both are at distances 1 and 2 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [39,4] at distance 1, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [39,4]."
29,60,movement,[35,13],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible range. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [35,13], [37,13], and [36,14]. Choosing to move to [35,13] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
29,96,movement,[9,40],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. All positions with the highest sugar value of 3.0 are considered. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0 and 1.41.

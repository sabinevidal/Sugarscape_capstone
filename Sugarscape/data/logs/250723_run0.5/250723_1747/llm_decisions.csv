31,90,movement,[16,39],"The agent is currently at position [15, 42] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 6. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4 at position [16, 39], which is unoccupied. This position is within the agent's vision and offers the maximum welfare compared to other unoccupied positions. Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 39]."
31,8,movement,[32,9],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. However, all positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and at distances ranging from 1.0 to 4.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [32,9]. Moving there maximizes welfare and is the closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar."
31,150,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [37,7] with sugar value 3.0. All visible positions have sugar values of 3.0 or less, but all positions with sugar value 3.0 are either occupied or the current position. The agent cannot move to any unoccupied position with higher sugar value. Therefore, the agent should not move."
31,135,movement,[31,4],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [31,4] and [33,3] have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at a similar distance (1.0 and 1.41 respectively). Choosing [31,4] as it is slightly closer and offers maximum welfare."
31,112,movement,[16,36],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible range. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [16,36]. Moving there maximizes welfare while minimizing movement distance."
31,23,movement,[33,3],"The agent is currently at position [34,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [33,3] and [35,5], both at distance 1.41. The agent can move to either, but chooses [33,3] as it is the first found with maximum sugar value and minimal distance."
31,105,movement,[16,34],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Among these, position [16,34] is unoccupied and closest with sugar 3.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [16,34] to maximize welfare."
31,85,movement,[38,11],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value visible in unoccupied positions is 4.0 at position [38,11]. This position is within vision range and unoccupied, so moving there maximizes welfare."
31,148,movement,[20,38],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, position [20,38] is unoccupied and has sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0, so moving there maximizes welfare."
31,81,movement,[31,11],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [31,11], [30,12], and [32,12]. These positions are unoccupied and provide maximum welfare. Choosing the closest one, [31,11], to move to."
31,2,movement,[19,36],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [19,36], [20,37], and at distance 1.41: [20,36]. Among these, [19,36] is the closest. Therefore, the agent should move to [19,36] to maximize welfare."
31,128,movement,[30,7],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The closest is at position [30,7] with sugar 3.0 and distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [30,7] to maximize welfare."
31,102,movement,[17,43],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [17,43] as it is the closest with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
31,123,movement,[29,1],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [29,1] and [28,2] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Both are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to [29,1] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare and unoccupied."
31,101,movement,[33,12],"The agent is currently at position [34,11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.41 ([33,12]) and 2.0 ([34,9]). The closest position with maximum sugar is [33,12]. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,12] to maximize welfare."
31,31,movement,[10,37],"The agent is currently at position [12, 37] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions all have sugar values of 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 2.0, such as [10, 37] and [14, 37]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value maximizes welfare. Therefore, the agent should move to [10, 37]."
31,31,reproduction,[59],"Agent 31 is female, age 32, with sugar 28.0 which is above the minimum required 20.0 for reproduction. The only eligible partner is agent 59, a male age 31 with sugar 13.0. Both have empty neighboring positions available for placing a child (agent 31 has [9,37],[10,38] and agent 59 has [10,35],[9,36]). Since agent 31 can reproduce with up to 1 partner and agent 59 meets all criteria (opposite sex, within vision, fertile, and has empty adjacent site), reproduction with agent 59 is chosen."
31,146,movement,[28,3],"The agent can see three positions within its vision range: its current position (29,3) with sugar value 1.0, and two adjacent unoccupied positions (28,3) and (29,4) both with sugar value 2.0. Since the agent aims to move to the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value), it should move to either (28,3) or (29,4). Both have equal sugar value and distance, so moving to (28,3) is chosen arbitrarily."
31,88,movement,[13,33],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available. Among these, the closest is at position [13,33] with a distance of 1.0. Therefore, the agent will move to [13,33]."
31,88,reproduction,[14],"Agent 88 is female, age 32, with sugar 15.5 which meets the minimum sugar requirement for reproduction (15.0). There is one eligible partner, agent 14, who is male, age 32, with sugar 30.0. Both agents have empty neighboring positions available for placing a child. Since max_partners is 1, agent 14 is selected as the reproduction partner. This pairing satisfies all reproduction criteria, so reproduction will occur with partner 14."
31,141,movement,[30,11],"The agent is currently at position [31,10] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0, but the closest one is at [30,11] with a distance of 1.41. Moving there maximizes welfare while minimizing distance."
31,7,movement,[13,29],"Among the visible positions, the position [13, 29] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare based on sugar availability within vision range."

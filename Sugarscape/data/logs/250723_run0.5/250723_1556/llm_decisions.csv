0,69,movement,[23,48],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [23,48], [22,49], [22,48], [23,47], and [21,49] all have the maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar are at distance 1.0: [23,48] and [22,49]. Choosing [23,48] as it is directly north and equally close."
0,59,movement,[18,29],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 2.0, which is the maximum welfare available in visible positions. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 2.0 are at distances 2.0 and 2.24. The closest position with maximum sugar is at [18,29] with distance 2.0, and it is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [18,29] to maximize welfare."
0,72,movement,[33,12],"The agent is currently at position [32, 13] with sugar value 3.0. There are multiple visible positions with a higher sugar value of 4.0 within the agent's vision range. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 4.0 are [33, 12] at distance 1.41 and [32, 11] and [34, 13] at distance 2.0. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value, which is [33, 12]. This position is unoccupied and provides the maximum welfare within the agent's vision."
0,45,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position also has zero sugar. Since no position offers better welfare, the agent will not move."
0,83,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent should stay in place."
0,10,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0 except the current position which also has 0 sugar. Since there is no unoccupied position with higher sugar value within vision, the agent will not move."
0,86,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent should stay in place."
0,55,movement,[29,6],"The agent has a vision of 3 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value visible is 3.0 at position [29,6], which is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare as it provides the maximum sugar within vision range."
0,35,movement,[31,4],"The agent has a vision of 4 and can see several positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value within vision is 3.0 at position [31,4]. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision range. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by collecting the maximum available sugar nearby."
0,49,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have zero sugar value, so there is no benefit in moving."
0,75,movement,[43,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, positions [43, 2] and [44, 3] both have the highest sugar value of 2 and are unoccupied. Since both are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, moving to [43, 2] is chosen arbitrarily as it is to the left of the current position."
0,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0. The current position also has 0 sugar. Since no unoccupied position offers higher sugar, the agent will not move."
0,28,movement,[27,18],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see several positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value visible is 2.0 at positions [27,18] and [26,17]. Both positions are unoccupied and within vision range. Among these, [27,18] is closer (distance 1.41) compared to [26,17] (distance 2.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [27,18] to maximize welfare by collecting the highest sugar value at the nearest position."
0,56,movement,[42,12],"The agent is currently at position [46,12] with sugar value 2.0. The agent's vision is 5, and it can see several positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances 4.0, 4.12, and 5.0. These positions are [42,12], [42,11], and [41,12], respectively. All these positions are unoccupied. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 4.0 and 4.12. The agent will choose the nearest one, which is [42,12] at distance 4.0. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake from 2.0 to 3.0."
0,80,movement,[47,19],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 1.0 within its vision range. All these positions have the same sugar value, so the agent will choose the nearest one to maximize welfare. The nearest unoccupied position with sugar 1.0 is at [47,19] with a distance of 2.83. Moving there will increase the agent's sugar intake compared to its current position which has sugar 0.0."
0,77,movement,[13,25],"Among the visible positions, the ones with the highest sugar value (1.0) are at positions [13,25], [15,25], and [14,26]. All these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest positions with maximum sugar are at distance 1.41. Choosing any of these positions will maximize welfare. I select position [13,25] as the target to move to."
0,3,movement,[30,5],"The agent is currently at position [30,6] with a sugar value of 3.0. The visible neighboring positions [30,5], [31,6], and [30,7] also have a sugar value of 3.0 but are unoccupied. Since all these positions have equal sugar value and are at the same distance, the agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Moving to any of these positions will not reduce welfare and may be beneficial for future movement or resource gathering."
0,38,movement,[38,16],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [38,16], [37,17], [37,16], [39,16], [38,15], and [36,17] all have the highest sugar value of 3.0. None of these positions are occupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [38,16] and [37,17]. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [38,16]."
0,64,movement,[20,7],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value within vision is 2.0 at position [17, 50], but it is too far (distance 44.0) and likely outside the agent's movement range. The next highest sugar values are 1.0 at several positions around [20,7], [21,6], [21,5], etc. Among these, the closest position with sugar 1.0 is [20,7] at distance 3.16, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent will move to [20,7] to maximize welfare within its vision and movement capability."
0,1,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will not move."
0,74,movement,[42,1],"The agent can see three nearby positions within its vision range: [42,1] with sugar 2.0, [43,1] with sugar 1.0 (current position), and [44,1] with sugar 1.0. The position [42,1] has the highest sugar value and is unoccupied, so moving there maximizes welfare."

0,13,movement,[17,29],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 2.0 at distances around 3 to 6. The agent's current position has sugar value 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value (2.0) are at distance 3.0 at positions [17,29] and [16,29]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing the closest one, [17,29], to maximize welfare."
0,84,movement,[26,17],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 2.0 at position [26,17]. This position is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by moving to the position with the maximum sugar value available within its vision."
0,44,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 2, so it can only consider positions within a distance of 2. All visible positions within this range have a sugar value of 0, which is not better than the current position's sugar value of 0. Therefore, there is no beneficial move to make."
0,99,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have a sugar value of 0.0, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying in place conserves energy and avoids unnecessary movement."
0,58,movement,[32,10],"The agent is currently at position [30,10] with a sugar value of 3.0. There are several visible positions within vision range that have a higher sugar value of 4.0, specifically at positions [32,10], [32,9], [32,11], and [33,10]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 4.0 are at distance 2.0 or 2.24. Since these positions are unoccupied, the agent should move to one of these positions to maximize welfare. The nearest position with maximum sugar value is [32,10] at distance 2.0, so the agent will move there."
0,36,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have zero sugar value, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying put conserves energy and avoids unnecessary movement."
0,61,movement,[25,5],"The agent has a vision of 3 and can see several positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value visible is 2.0 at positions [25,5] and [26,4]. Both positions are unoccupied. Among these, [25,5] is closer (distance 2.24) compared to [26,4] (distance 3.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [25,5] to maximize welfare by collecting the highest sugar value at the nearest position."
0,46,movement,[18,40],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value visible in unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [18,40], [18,41], and [17,40]. Among these, the closest is at distance 5.0 at [18,40]. Since these positions are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value within vision, the agent will move to the nearest one, which is [18,40]."
0,30,movement,[16,37],"The agent is currently at position [17, 36] with a sugar value of 3. There are two nearby unoccupied positions within vision range that have a higher sugar value of 4: [16, 37] at distance 1.41 and [17, 38] at distance 2. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [16, 37]."

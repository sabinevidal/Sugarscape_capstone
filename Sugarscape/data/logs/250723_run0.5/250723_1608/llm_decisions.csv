3,72,movement,[34,11],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar values. The maximum sugar value visible is 4.0 at several positions within vision range. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 4.0 are at distance 2.0 (positions [34,11] and [34,12]). Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [34,11]."
3,36,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have a sugar value of 0.0, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying put conserves energy and avoids unnecessary movement."
3,9,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
3,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have sugar value 0 except the current position which also has 0 sugar. Therefore, there is no better position to move to for increasing welfare."
3,34,movement,[8,32],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [8, 32] and [7, 33] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at the same distance (1.0). Choosing to move to [8, 32] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare (highest sugar)."
3,2,movement,[14,41],"The agent is currently at position [13, 41] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4, located at positions [14, 41], [14, 40], [15, 41], [14, 39], [15, 40], [15, 39], [16, 41], [16, 42], [16, 43], [17, 41], [17, 42], and [18, 41]. Among these, the nearest unoccupied position is [14, 41] at distance 1.0. Since this position is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value within vision, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
3,12,movement,[35,8],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 4.0 at distances ranging from 2.0 to 4.47. Since the movement rule is to move to the nearest position producing maximum welfare, the agent should move to the closest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value. The closest positions with sugar value 4.0 are at [35,8] (distance 2.0) and [35,9] (distance 2.24). Both are unoccupied. The agent will choose the closest one, [35,8]."
3,15,movement,[31,16],"The agent has a vision of 4 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value visible in unoccupied positions is 3.0 at position [31,16]. This position is within the agent's vision and is unoccupied, so moving there maximizes the agent's welfare."
3,77,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare, there is no benefit in moving."
3,39,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
3,46,movement,[15,40],"The agent is currently at position [16,40] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 4. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 4 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The nearest positions with sugar 4 are [15,40] and [16,41] at distance 1.0. Moving to either of these positions will maximize welfare. Choosing [15,40] as the target position as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar value."
3,11,movement,[34,4],"The agent can see several unoccupied positions within its vision range. Among these, the positions [34,4] and [35,3] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are unoccupied and within vision. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [34,4] at a distance of 1.41, which is closer than [35,3] at distance 2.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,4] to maximize welfare."
3,63,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
3,92,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 2 and can only move to unoccupied positions within that range. All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 0, which is not better than the current position's sugar value of 0. Therefore, there is no benefit in moving."
3,59,movement,[16,34],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [16,34] and [17,35]. Choosing [16,34] as it is the first encountered with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
3,18,movement,[43,16],"The agent is currently at position [43,17] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3 at positions [41,14] and [39,16], but these are farther away (3.61 and 4.12 distance respectively). There are multiple positions with sugar value 2 within 1 to 2 distance, such as [43,16], [42,17], [44,17], [43,18], etc. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 2 are at distance 1. Moving to any of these positions will increase the agent's welfare compared to the current position. Since the agent should move to the nearest position with maximum welfare, it will move to one of the positions with sugar value 2 at distance 1. Choosing [43,16] as the target position as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar value 2."
3,78,movement,[33,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [33,1] and [34,2] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at distance 1.0, so either can be chosen. Moving to [33,1] will maximize welfare by increasing sugar intake."
3,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to for increasing welfare, the agent will stay in place."
3,85,movement,[29,12],"The agent is currently at position [28, 12] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4 at [34, 12], but it is at distance 6 and unoccupied. The next highest sugar value visible is 3 at multiple positions closer than 6 units, such as [29, 12], [29, 11], and [29, 13], all unoccupied. Among these, the closest with maximum sugar is [29, 12] at distance 1. Moving there maximizes welfare while being the nearest position with maximum sugar value available."
3,14,movement,[14,39],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the position [14, 39] has the highest sugar value of 4.0 and is within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare as per the movement rule."
3,56,movement,[37,10],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The maximum sugar value available in these positions is 4.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 4.0 are at distance 1.0 and 2.0. The closest position with sugar 4.0 is at [37,10], which is unoccupied and within vision. Therefore, the agent moves to [37,10] to maximize its welfare."

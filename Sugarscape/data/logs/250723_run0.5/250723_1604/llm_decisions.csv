2,46,movement,[16,40],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 4, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [16,40] and [17,41]. Choosing [16,40] as it is the first encountered with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
2,42,movement,[25,12],"All visible positions within vision have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, any position is equally good, so the agent will move to [25, 12]."
2,47,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. There is no benefit in moving to any other position as they do not provide higher welfare."
2,35,movement,null,"The agent's vision is 4, so it can only consider positions within a distance of 4. All visible positions within vision have sugar value 0, including the current position. Therefore, there is no better position to move to within vision. The agent will not move."
2,71,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is equal to the current position's sugar value. Since the agent is already on a position with maximum welfare (sugar value 1.0) and no other position offers higher sugar, the agent will not move."
2,32,movement,[25,39],"All visible positions within vision have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent is currently on a position with sugar value 1.0. Moving to any adjacent position with sugar value 2.0 will increase welfare. The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, the agent selects position [25, 39]."
2,25,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
2,10,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar except the current position which also has zero sugar. There are no unoccupied positions with sugar to move to. Therefore, the agent will not move."
2,50,movement,[14,33],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The maximum sugar value visible is 3.0 at positions [14,33], [13,33], and [15,33], all at a distance of about 4.0 to 4.12. These positions are unoccupied. Moving to any of these positions will maximize the agent's welfare. Among these, [14,33] is directly north and at distance 4.0, so it is chosen as the target position."
2,45,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, so there is no better position to move to for increasing welfare. The current position is unoccupied and has the same sugar value as all others, so the agent will stay in place."
2,26,movement,[44,15],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [44,15] which is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
2,15,movement,[29,18],"Among the visible positions, several have the maximum sugar value of 2.0. The closest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [29,18], [28,19], and [30,19]. All these positions are unoccupied. Choosing [29,18] as it is directly adjacent and provides maximum welfare."
2,14,movement,[13,38],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 4.0 except for a few with lower values. Among the positions with sugar value 4.0, the closest ones are at distance 1.0: [13,38], [12,39], and [14,39]. Since all these positions are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [13,38] as it is directly north and at minimal distance."
2,83,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
2,27,movement,[36,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [36,1], [38,1], and [37,2] each have the maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar value and distance, moving to any of these positions is equally beneficial. Choosing to move to [36,1]."
2,96,movement,[12,41],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at position [12, 41], which is unoccupied and within vision. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other positions with sugar value 3 or less."
2,67,movement,[13,33],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value visible is 3.0 at positions [13,33] and [12,34]. Both are at or near the maximum vision distance. These positions are unoccupied and provide the maximum welfare in terms of sugar. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [13,33] at a distance of 4.12, closer than [12,34] at distance 5.0."
2,9,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
2,70,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
2,76,movement,[23,27],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 1.0 except for some positions with 0.0 sugar. The current position has sugar 1.0 but is occupied by the agent itself. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar (1.0) are at distance 1.0 from the agent's current position. Choosing one of these positions to move to will maximize welfare. Among these, positions [23,27], [22,28], [24,28], and [23,29] are unoccupied and have sugar 1.0. Selecting the closest one, for example, [23,27]."

28,15,movement,[39,9],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with lower values. The agent's vision is 4, and the closest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Among these, the position [39,9] is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value of 3.0 at the shortest distance (1.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [39,9]."
28,107,movement,null,"All adjacent positions within vision are occupied or have lower sugar value than the current position. The current position has sugar value 1.0, and no unoccupied position within vision offers better welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."
28,123,movement,[29,2],"All adjacent positions have the same sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing to move to position [29,2] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value."
28,145,movement,[34,2],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0 except for a few with 1.0 or 0.0. Among the positions with sugar 2.0, the closest unoccupied positions are [34,2], [35,3], and [36,1]. Since all have the same sugar value, the agent will move to the nearest one, which is at distance 1.0. Choosing [34,2] as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar value."
28,137,movement,[13,33],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are not occupied. All unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available nearby. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [13,33] and [15,33]. The agent chooses to move to [13,33], which is the nearest position with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
28,26,movement,[40,5],"The agent can see multiple positions within its vision range that have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available nearby. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [40,5] and [41,6], both at distance 1.0. Since [41,7] is occupied, the agent cannot move there. Choosing [40,5] as the target position because it is unoccupied and provides maximum sugar within the nearest distance."
28,38,movement,[36,1],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see several unoccupied positions with sugar value 2.0 at distances 1.0 and 1.41. Since all these positions have the same maximum sugar value within vision, the agent will move to the nearest one to maximize welfare. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [36,1], [35,2], and [37,2]. The agent is currently at [36,2]. Among these, moving to [36,1] is a straightforward move upwards and is chosen as the target position."
28,126,movement,[11,35],"The agent is currently at position [11, 36]. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. Several positions have this sugar value, but some are occupied by other agents. The unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 and closest distance are [11, 35] and [12, 36], both at distance 1.0. The agent can move to either. Choosing [11, 35] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare within vision."
28,114,movement,[34,9],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are not occupied. The maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 2.24 (positions [34,9], [36,9], [37,10]). The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [34,9]."
28,110,movement,[38,12],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [38,12]. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare. Therefore, the agent should move to [38,12]."
28,135,movement,[33,3],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 2.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [33,3] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,3] to maximize welfare."
28,139,movement,[31,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [31,2], [30,3], [31,3], and [30,4] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value (2.0) are at distance 1.0: [31,2] and [30,3]. Choosing [31,2] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
28,31,movement,[14,38],"The agent is currently at position [14, 40] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 5, and it can see several positions with sugar value 3 at distances ranging from 2.0 to 4.12. All these positions with sugar value 3 are unoccupied, which is better than the current position's sugar value. The nearest such position is [14, 38] at distance 2.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 38] to maximize welfare."
28,138,movement,[15,38],"The agent is currently at position [16, 38] with a sugar value of 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0, but all positions with sugar value 3.0 are occupied except for [15, 38] and [17, 37]. Both are at distance 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The agent chooses to move to [15, 38] as it is the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value (3.0)."
28,140,movement,[11,39],"The agent is currently at position [12, 39] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 to 3.16. The closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [11, 39], [11, 38], and [11, 40], all at distance 1.0 or 1.41. However, [11, 39], [11, 38], and [11, 40] are unoccupied as they are not listed in occupied_positions. Therefore, the agent should move to the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value, which is [11, 39]."
28,2,movement,[18,38],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0: [18,38], [20,38], and [19,39]. Since all have equal sugar and distance, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [18,38] as it is the first in the list and unoccupied."
28,2,reproduction,[5],"Agent 2 is male, age 29, with sugar 59.0 which is above the minimum sugar for reproduction (6.0). There is one eligible partner, agent 5, who is female, age 29, with sugar 79.0. Both have empty neighboring positions (agent 2 has [18,37],[19,38] and agent 5 has [19,39],[18,40]), satisfying the condition for reproduction. Since max_partners is 4 and only one eligible partner is available, agent 2 will reproduce with agent 5. This choice maximizes reproductive opportunity while meeting all criteria."
28,46,movement,[14,37],"The agent is currently at position [15,37] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar value 3 at various distances. However, all positions with sugar value 3 are occupied. The next best sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 2. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with sugar value 2 are [14,37] and [16,37], both at distance 1. The agent will choose to move to [14,37] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (sugar value 2) that is unoccupied."
29,142,movement,[33,8],"The agent is currently at position [29,9] with sugar 21.5. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [33,8] with 4.0 sugar. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision range (distance 4.12). Moving there maximizes welfare as it has the highest sugar value among unoccupied visible positions."
29,52,movement,[34,8],"The agent is currently at position [32,8] with sugar value 1. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [34,8] and [36,9]. Both positions are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar) is [34,8] at distance 2.0, which is closer than [36,9] at distance 4.12. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,8] to maximize welfare."
29,5,movement,[18,41],"The agent is currently at position [18, 39] with sugar 68. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [18, 41] with sugar 4.0 and [18, 40] with sugar 3.0. However, [18, 40] is occupied, so it cannot move there. The position [18, 41] is unoccupied and has the highest sugar value among visible unoccupied positions. It is also the nearest position with maximum welfare. Therefore, the agent should move to [18, 41]."
29,105,movement,[17,35],"The agent is currently at position [18, 35] with a sugar value of 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except one with 2.0 and the current position with 1.0. Since the movement rule is to move to the nearest position producing maximum welfare, the agent should move to one of the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0. The closest such positions are at distance 1.0: [17, 35] and [19, 35]. Either is equally good, so the agent will move to [17, 35]."
29,118,movement,[12,41],"The agent is currently at position [17, 40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [12, 41] has the highest sugar value of 4.0, which is greater than the current position and all other visible unoccupied positions. It is also within the agent's vision range. Therefore, moving to [12, 41] maximizes the agent's welfare."
29,38,movement,[35,1],"The agent has a vision of 2 and sees several unoccupied positions with sugar value 2.0 at distance 1 or 1.41. Since all these positions have the same maximum sugar value and are unoccupied, the agent will move to the nearest one with maximum welfare, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, the position [35,1] is chosen as it is the first encountered with maximum sugar value and minimum distance."

17,15,movement,[35,12],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [35,12] and [35,14]. Choosing to move to [35,12] as it is the first encountered with maximum welfare and closest distance."
17,69,movement,[18,35],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [18,35], [17,36], [18,37], [17,35], [17,37], and [19,37] all have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Any of these positions at distance 1.0 with sugar 3.0 are equally good. The agent selects position [18,35] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
17,30,movement,[10,36],"Among the visible positions, several have the maximum sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest position with maximum sugar is [10, 36] at distance 1.0, which is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare by collecting the highest sugar nearby with minimal movement cost."
17,96,movement,[14,34],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0, and all positions with sugar 3.0 are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0, such as [14,34], [13,35], and [15,35]. Choosing the closest one, [14,34], which is unoccupied and has maximum sugar, will maximize welfare."
17,81,movement,[34,6],"The agent is currently at position [34,7] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, but many of these positions are occupied. The unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 are [34,6], [33,7], [33,6], [35,6], and [33,8]. All these positions have the same sugar value and are at distance 1 or approximately 1.41. The agent will choose the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is any of the positions at distance 1. Among these, [34,6] and [33,7] are at distance 1. The agent will move to [34,6] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, maximizing welfare."
17,14,movement,[15,34],"The agent can move to any adjacent position with sugar value 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision and unoccupied. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [16,33], [15,34], and [16,35]. Choosing [15,34] as it is unoccupied and provides maximum sugar at minimal distance."
17,14,reproduction,[96],"Agent 14 is male, age 18, with sugar 32, which is above the minimum sugar required for reproduction (10). There is one eligible partner, agent 96, who is female, age 18, with sugar 37, and has empty nearby positions. Both agents have empty neighboring sites, satisfying the reproduction conditions. Since max_partners is 2 but only one eligible partner is available, agent 14 will reproduce with agent 96."
17,57,movement,[11,42],"The agent is currently at position [12, 42] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, but all these positions are at least 1 unit away and are unoccupied. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are [11, 42] and [11, 43]. Moving to [11, 42] is the nearest position with maximum welfare (sugar value 3) and is unoccupied, so the agent should move there to maximize sugar intake."
17,12,movement,[35,4],"The agent is currently at position [34,5] with sugar 28. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [35,4], [33,6], and [35,6], all at distance approximately 1.41. Moving to any of these positions would increase the agent's sugar intake from 1.0 at current position to 3.0. Choosing [35,4] as it is closest and unoccupied."
17,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
17,7,movement,[15,33],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position at [15, 33] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare according to the movement rule."
17,2,movement,[14,37],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is lower than the sugar values of the occupied neighboring positions. Since the agent cannot move to occupied positions and all unoccupied positions have equal sugar value, the agent will move to the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value, which is 3.0. The closest such position is [14,37], which is at distance 1.0."
17,2,reproduction,[5],"Agent 2 is male, age 18, with sufficient sugar (52.0) above the minimum required for reproduction (6.0). There is one eligible partner, Agent 5, who is female, age 18, and also has sufficient sugar (62.0). Both have empty neighboring positions, satisfying the condition for reproduction. Since max_partners is 4 and only one eligible partner is available, Agent 5 is selected for reproduction."
17,50,movement,[11,43],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or less, and all positions with sugar 3.0 are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [11,43] and [12,44]. Choosing [11,43] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
17,66,movement,[39,3],"The agent is currently at position [38,4] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 4, and it can see multiple positions with sugar value 2 that are unoccupied. The nearest positions with sugar value 2 are at distances 1.0 to 2.24. Among these, position [38,3] is occupied, so it cannot move there. The next best unoccupied positions with sugar value 2 are [39,3], [38,2], [36,4], [40,4], [37,2], [39,2], [36,3], [40,3], [36,5], and [40,5]. The closest among these is [39,3] at distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [39,3] to maximize welfare by moving to the nearest position with the highest sugar value available."
17,90,movement,[10,38],"The agent is currently at position [10, 39] with sugar value 1.0. All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, but the maximum sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, such as [10, 38], [11, 39], [9, 38], [11, 38], and [9, 40]. These positions are unoccupied and provide the maximum welfare within the agent's vision. The agent will move to the nearest such position, which is at distance 1.0. Choosing [10, 38] as the target position for movement as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
17,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have sugar value 0 except the current position which also has sugar value 0. Therefore, there is no better position to move to for maximizing welfare."
18,84,movement,[33,8],"The agent is currently at position [32, 11] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are at [33, 8], [36, 11], [36, 12], and [37, 11], each with sugar value 4. Among these, [33, 8] is the closest at a distance of 3.16. Therefore, the agent should move to [33, 8] to maximize welfare."
18,103,movement,[36,11],"The agent is currently at position [35,11] with a sugar value of 3. Nearby positions within vision have sugar values of 4, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 4 are [36,11] at distance 1.0, [36,12] at distance 1.41, [37,11] at distance 2.0, and [37,9] at distance 2.83. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar value is [36,11]. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,11] to maximize welfare."
18,5,movement,[15,38],"The agent is currently at position [15, 37] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 4.0, available at multiple positions such as [15, 38], [15, 39], [14, 39], and [15, 40]. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 4.0 is [15, 38], which is at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 38] to maximize welfare."

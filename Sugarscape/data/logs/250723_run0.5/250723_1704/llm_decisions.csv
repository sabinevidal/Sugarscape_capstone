21,107,movement,[32,1],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see three positions: its current position (31,1) with sugar 1.0, (32,1) with sugar 2.0, and a distant position (31,50) with sugar 0.0. Among unoccupied positions within vision, (32,1) has the highest sugar value of 2.0. Therefore, the agent should move to (32,1) to maximize welfare."
21,125,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, and the current position has a sugar value of 3.0. Since moving to any other position does not increase welfare and all positions with higher sugar are occupied, the agent should not move."
21,87,movement,[15,35],"The agent can see three positions within its vision range: its current position (15,34) with sugar 1.0, position (15,35) with sugar 3.0, and position (16,34) with sugar 2.0. Both (15,35) and (16,34) are unoccupied. Among these, (15,35) has the highest sugar value of 3.0, which maximizes welfare. Therefore, the agent should move to (15,35)."
21,105,movement,[14,36],"The agent is currently at position [14, 37] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value (3.0) are at [14, 36], [13, 36], [15, 38], [14, 39], [13, 35], [12, 35], [17, 37], [13, 34], [11, 36], [17, 36], [15, 40], [12, 34], [17, 35], [18, 37], [14, 41], [13, 33], [10, 36], [18, 36], [18, 38], [13, 41], [17, 34], [16, 33], [10, 35], [18, 35], [10, 39], [16, 41], [9, 37], [19, 37], [9, 36], [19, 36], [9, 38], [19, 38], [20, 37], [14, 43]. Among these, the closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [14, 36] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 36]."
21,29,movement,[40,11],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, for example [40,11], [41,12], and [40,13]. Moving to any of these will maximize welfare by increasing sugar intake. Choosing [40,11] as it is the closest and directly adjacent."
21,27,movement,[28,2],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [28,2] and [27,3] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is equally good. Choosing to move to [28,2]."
21,88,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the agent's current sugar level of 24.0. Moving to any of these positions would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."
21,24,movement,[13,41],"The agent is currently at position [12,40] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible unoccupied positions, all have sugar values of 3.0 or 2.0, which are higher than the current position. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distances ranging from 1.41 to 6.0. The closest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0 is at [13,41] with distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [13,41] to maximize welfare."
21,71,movement,[22,31],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 2.0, which is the maximum welfare available nearby. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0. Since none of these positions are occupied, the agent can move to any of them. Choosing position [22, 31] as it is directly north and at minimal distance."
21,60,movement,[32,6],"The agent is currently at position [32,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0. These positions are [32,6], [31,7], [33,6], and [33,8], all at distance 1 or 1.41. The agent chooses to move to [32,6] which is the nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 and is unoccupied."
21,60,reproduction,[93],"The agent (ID 60) is female, age 22, with sugar 36.0, which is above the minimum sugar required for reproduction (24.0). There is one eligible partner (ID 93), a male aged 21 with sugar 55.0, within vision range. Both have empty neighboring sites (agent 60 has positions [33,6] and [32,7]; partner 93 has positions [31,5], [30,6], and [31,7]). Since the partner is of opposite sex, fertile, within vision, and at least one of them has an empty adjacent site, reproduction is possible. The agent can reproduce with up to 1 partner, so partner 93 is selected for reproduction."
21,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
21,30,movement,[12,34],"Among the visible positions, several have the maximum sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest positions with maximum sugar are [12,34] at distance 1.0 and [10,35], [12,35] at distance 1.41. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [12,34]."
21,55,movement,[32,4],"The agent is currently at position [32,5] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0, available at multiple positions within vision range. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [32,4] and [33,5]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [32,4] as it is directly adjacent and provides maximum welfare."
21,119,movement,[36,5],"The agent is currently at position [37,6] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at various distances. The nearest position with sugar value 3.0 is at distance 1.41, for example [36,5] or [38,7]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value to maximize welfare, the agent will move to [36,5]."
21,104,movement,[16,33],"The agent is currently at position [15,33] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 5, and it can see multiple positions with sugar value 3 that are unoccupied. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0 to 2.24. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [16,33] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [16,33] to maximize its welfare."
21,126,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is lower than the sugar at the current position (9.5). Moving to any of these positions would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should stay in place."
21,102,movement,[14,44],"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0. Since positions [14,44], [16,44], [15,45] are unoccupied and have maximum welfare (sugar value 3.0) at the nearest distance, the agent will move to one of these. Choosing [14,44] arbitrarily among the nearest maximum welfare positions."
21,59,movement,[11,36],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 2.24 (positions [11,36], [13,36], [10,39], [14,39]). These positions are unoccupied and within vision range. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [11,36]."
21,59,reproduction,[96],"Agent 59 is male, age 22, with sugar 22 which is above the minimum required 12 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 96, who is female, age 21, and has sugar 28. Both have empty neighboring positions (agent 59 has three empty nearby positions and agent 96 has one). Since the partner is within vision range and fertile, and the agent has enough sugar, reproduction is possible. Only one partner is allowed (max_partners=1), so agent 96 is chosen for reproduction."
21,40,movement,[14,39],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. However, the current position is occupied by the agent itself, so it can move to a position with higher sugar value. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.41 or 2.0. Among these, position [14,39] is unoccupied and closest with sugar 3.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [14,39]."
21,85,movement,[37,11],"The agent is currently at position [37,12] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are [37,11], [36,12], and [38,12], all at distance 1. These positions are unoccupied and provide the maximum welfare within the agent's vision. Therefore, the agent should move to one of these positions to maximize its sugar intake. Choosing [37,11] as the target position as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."

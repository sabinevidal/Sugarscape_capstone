36,138,movement,[13,37],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [13,37], [12,38], and [13,39]. All these positions are unoccupied. Choosing the nearest position with maximum welfare, I select [13,37]."
36,17,movement,[11,30],"Among the visible positions within vision range, positions [11, 30] and [10, 31] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to [11, 30] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare."
36,139,movement,[30,5],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [30,5] and [31,6], both at distance 1.0. Choosing [30,5] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
36,30,movement,[12,30],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [12,30], which is unoccupied and has sugar value 2.0, to maximize welfare."
36,124,movement,[33,10],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is lower than the sugar values of occupied neighboring positions. Since the agent can only move to unoccupied positions, it chooses the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. Among these, positions [33,10], [35,10], and [34,11] are at distance 1.0 and have sugar 3.0. The agent chooses to move to [33,10] as it is the first such position found at minimum distance with maximum sugar value."
36,140,movement,[12,34],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Among these positions, the closest ones with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The agent chooses to move to position [12,34], which is unoccupied, has sugar value 3.0, and is the nearest position with maximum welfare."
36,71,movement,[16,35],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, but the maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 2.0. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is at [16, 35] with sugar 3.0 and distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
36,163,movement,[15,34],"The agent is currently at position [17,33] with a sugar value of 3.0. All visible positions with the maximum sugar value of 3.0 are at various distances, but many of these positions are unoccupied. The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value is [15,34] or [19,34], both at a distance of approximately 2.24. Choosing [15,34] as it is the first found nearest position with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
36,116,movement,[17,41],"The agent is currently at position [20, 41] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 4.0 at positions [17, 41], [17, 40], and [17, 42], all at a distance of about 3.0 to 3.16. These positions are unoccupied and provide the highest welfare within the agent's vision. The agent will move to the nearest of these positions, which is [17, 41]."
36,133,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is lower than the sugar at the current position (27.5). Moving to any of these positions would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should stay in place to maximize welfare."
36,119,movement,[42,8],"The agent is currently at position [41,7] with sugar value 1.0. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 6. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0, and several positions with sugar 3.0 are unoccupied. The nearest such position is [42,8] at distance 1.41. Moving there maximizes welfare by moving to the highest sugar value within vision and is unoccupied."
36,93,movement,[30,8],"The agent is currently at position [31,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0. These positions are [30,8], [30,9], [31,6], [32,6], [29,7], [30,10], and [33,6]. The nearest position with sugar 3.0 is [30,8] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [30,8] to maximize welfare."
36,112,movement,[17,40],"The agent is currently at position [15, 36]. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value available in an unoccupied position is 4.0 at position [17, 40]. This position is within the agent's vision and is unoccupied, making it the best move to maximize welfare. Other positions have lower sugar values or are occupied."
36,26,movement,[38,5],"Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [38,5] and [37,4]. Both are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [38,5] at a distance of 1.41, which is closer than [37,4] at distance 2.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [38,5] to maximize welfare."
36,147,movement,[37,1],"All visible positions within vision have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent can move to any of these positions. Choosing to move to position [37, 1], which is one step to the left, as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare."
36,118,movement,[9,42],"The agent is currently at position [8, 42] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0, available at multiple positions such as [9, 42], [9, 41], and [9, 43]. These positions are at a distance of 1.0 to 1.41, which is within the agent's vision of 6. The nearest position with maximum sugar value is [9, 42] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [9, 42] to maximize welfare."
36,144,movement,[33,1],"Among the visible and unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 2.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (2.0) are at distance 1.0 and 2.0. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is at [33,1] with sugar 2.0 and distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare."
36,80,movement,[28,9],"The agent is currently at position [28,10] with sugar 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value (3.0) are at [28,9], [30,10], [30,9], [29,7], and [29,13]. Among these, [28,9] is the closest (distance 1.0) and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [28,9] to maximize welfare."
36,145,movement,[36,4],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision, the position [36,4] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is at distance 2.0, which is within the agent's vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other positions with sugar values of 2.0 or less."
36,23,movement,[33,5],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0. These positions are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [33,5] and [32,6]. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [33,5]."
36,113,movement,[27,3],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see three unoccupied positions each with a sugar value of 2.0 at positions [27,3], [29,3], and [28,4]. All these positions have the same sugar value and are at the same distance. The agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [27,3] arbitrarily among the best options."
36,162,movement,[17,42],"The agent is currently at position [12,43] with sugar value 3.0. Nearby positions with higher sugar values are occupied. The unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within vision is [17,42] with sugar value 4.0, at a distance of 5.1, which is reachable and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare."
36,37,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [36,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. However, all positions with sugar value 3.0 are occupied, so the agent cannot move there. The next best sugar value is 2.0, but all positions with sugar value 2.0 are also occupied. Therefore, the agent cannot move to a position with higher welfare. Hence, the agent will not move."

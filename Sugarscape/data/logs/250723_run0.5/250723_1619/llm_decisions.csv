6,77,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare, there is no benefit in moving."
6,71,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is equal to the current position's sugar value. Since the current position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare, there is no benefit in moving."
6,88,movement,[15,42],"The agent is currently at position [17, 43]. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [15, 42] and [16, 40]. Both are at distances 2.24 and 3.16 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [15, 42]. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 42]."
6,50,movement,[16,40],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the position [16, 40] has the highest sugar value of 4.0. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision, so moving there maximizes the agent's welfare."
6,49,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have a sugar value of 0.0, and none are occupied. Since there is no position with higher sugar value than the current position, the agent will not move."
6,54,movement,[15,39],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible range. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 2.0. Since the agent is currently at position [17,39], moving to any of these positions will yield the same sugar value. Choosing position [15,39] as it is unoccupied and at minimum distance."
6,42,movement,[24,9],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, the agent can move to any of the positions [24,9], [25,10], or [24,11]. Choosing [24,9] arbitrarily as it is one of the closest and has maximum sugar value."
6,8,movement,[34,12],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except a few with 2.0 and the current position has sugar 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, so the agent should move to one of these positions. Choosing position [34,12] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied with sugar 3.0."
6,85,movement,[34,8],"The agent is currently at position [32,9] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar values mostly 3 or 4. The highest sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 4, found at positions [34,8] and [38,9]. Among these, [34,8] is closer (distance 2.24) compared to [38,9] (distance 6). Therefore, the agent should move to [34,8] to maximize welfare by moving to the nearest position with the highest sugar value available within its vision."
6,65,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have the same sugar value of 1.0. Since the current position is already occupied by the agent and has maximum welfare, and moving to any adjacent position does not increase welfare, the agent will not move."
6,52,movement,[31,11],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [31,11] and [31,12]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum welfare, the agent will move to [31,11]."
6,38,movement,[38,12],"Among the visible positions, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for two with lower sugar values (2.0 and 1.0). The agent's vision is 2, so it can see all these positions. Since all the best positions have the same sugar value, the agent will move to the nearest one with maximum sugar value. The closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [38,12], [39,13], and [38,14]. The agent can choose any of these. Choosing [38,12] as it is directly north and unoccupied."
6,100,movement,[20,40],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1. To maximize welfare, the agent should move to the nearest position with sugar value 3. The closest such positions are at distance 1.0: [20,40] and [21,41]. Choosing [20,40] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
6,75,movement,[38,1],"Among the unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [38,1], [40,1], and [39,2] all have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally near and have the same sugar value, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [38,1] arbitrarily as the target position."
6,69,movement,[21,43],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The positions with sugar 3.0 are [21,43], [20,44], [20,45], and [19,44]. However, [21,42] is occupied, so it is excluded. The nearest positions with maximum sugar are [21,43] and [20,44], both at distance 1.0. Choosing [21,43] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare."
6,10,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0 except the current position which has 0 sugar and a distant position at [39,1] with sugar value 1. However, the distant position is 44 units away, which is beyond the agent's vision range of 6. Therefore, the agent cannot move to a position with higher sugar value within its vision. Since all nearby positions have zero sugar and are unoccupied, the agent will not move."
6,23,movement,[35,3],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0 except for two positions with sugar values of 2.0 and the current position with sugar value 1.0. Among the positions with sugar value 3.0, the nearest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0: [35,3], [34,4], and [36,4]. Since all have equal sugar and distance, any of these positions is optimal. I choose to move to [35,3] as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare at minimum distance."
6,2,movement,[12,38],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. Among these, the closest positions at distance 1.0 are [12,38] and [12,40]. Both are unoccupied and equally good. Choosing to move to [12,38] as it is directly adjacent and offers maximum sugar."
6,34,movement,[8,31],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the positions [8,31], [10,31], and [9,32] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. All are at distance 1.0, so the agent can move to any of these to maximize welfare. Choosing [8,31] as the target position to move to."
6,12,movement,[32,6],"The agent is currently at position [33,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0, but the nearest one is at distance 1.41, for example [32,6] or [32,8]. Choosing [32,6] as it is the closest position with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
6,35,movement,null,"The agent's vision is 4, so it can only consider positions within a distance of 4. All visible positions with sugar greater than 0 are far beyond the vision range (distances around 46 and more). Within the vision range, all positions have 0 sugar. Therefore, the agent should not move as there is no better position within vision to move to."
6,37,movement,[38,9],"The agent is currently at position [34, 9] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions within this range. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4 at position [38, 9]. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision. Moving there will maximize the agent's welfare by increasing its sugar intake."
6,27,movement,[32,1],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [32,1], [34,1], and [33,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. All are at distance 1, so the agent can move to any of these to maximize welfare. Choosing [32,1] arbitrarily among these equally optimal options."

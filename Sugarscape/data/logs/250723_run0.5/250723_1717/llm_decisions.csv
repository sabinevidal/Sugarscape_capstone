24,125,movement,[12,37],"The agent is currently at position [12, 38] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [12, 37], [11, 39], [11, 36], [10, 37], [10, 39], [14, 39], [11, 40], [10, 36], [14, 36], [10, 40], [11, 41], [13, 41], [15, 36], [15, 40], [14, 41], [12, 42], [13, 34], [11, 42], [17, 38], [12, 43]. Among these, the nearest positions are [12, 37] (distance 1.0) and [11, 39] (distance 1.41). Since [12, 37] is the closest and has the maximum sugar value available, the agent should move there."
24,127,movement,[36,13],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [36,13], [37,14], and [36,15]. These positions are unoccupied and within vision. Moving to any of these positions will maximize welfare. Choosing [36,13] as it is the closest and directly adjacent."
24,96,movement,[10,36],"The agent is currently at position [10, 35] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are at distance 1.0 and have sugar value 3.0, specifically positions [10, 36], [11, 36], and [10, 37]. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar are at distance 1.0 and have sugar value 3.0. The agent will move to [10, 36] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar) and is unoccupied."
24,17,movement,[11,30],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [11, 30] and [10, 31] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is equally good. Choosing to move to [11, 30]."
24,101,movement,[36,7],"The agent is currently at position [35,7] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions have sugar values of 3.0 at various distances, but all these positions are occupied.

Among these, the closest with maximum sugar value 2.0 is [36,7] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,7]."
24,108,movement,[34,12],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0: [34,12] and [36,11]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [34,12] as it is the first found with maximum sugar at minimum distance."
24,59,movement,[11,36],"The agent is currently at position [11, 37] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 2.0. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [11, 36] and [10, 37], both at distance 1.0. Choosing [11, 36] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare within vision range."
24,59,reproduction,[96],"Agent 59 is male, age 25, with sugar 13.0 which is above the minimum required 12.0 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 96, who is female, age 25, with sugar 19.0. Both have empty neighboring positions available for placing a child. Since max_partners is 1, agent 59 can reproduce with agent 96. This meets all reproduction criteria, so reproduction will occur with partner 96."
24,90,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [17, 39] with sugar 24.0. All visible positions have sugar values of 3.0 or less, which is significantly lower than the current position's sugar value. Additionally, all positions with higher sugar values are occupied. Therefore, moving would not increase the agent's welfare. The agent should stay in place to maximize welfare."
24,134,movement,[30,6],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are not occupied. The maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [30,6], [32,6], [30,9], and [33,6]. Among these, [30,6] is the closest with a distance of 1.0. Therefore, the agent moves to [30,6] to maximize its welfare."
24,85,movement,[39,10],"The agent is currently at position [38,10] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value is [39,10] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [39,10] to maximize welfare."
24,66,movement,[36,5],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is lower than the sugar values of occupied neighboring positions. However, since the agent must move to an unoccupied position with maximum welfare, it chooses one of the unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 that is nearest. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.41: (36,5) and (38,7). Either is acceptable; choosing (36,5)."
24,112,movement,[17,41],"The agent is currently at position [17, 40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [17, 41], [16, 41], and [18, 41], all at a distance of about 1.0 to 1.41. Choosing the closest one, [17, 41], maximizes welfare and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 41]."
24,136,movement,[34,1],"The agent is currently at position [34, 2] with sugar value 1.0. All adjacent positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all these positions have equal maximum sugar value, the agent will move to the nearest one, which is at distance 1.0. Choosing position [34, 1] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
24,88,movement,[14,39],"The agent is currently at position [14, 40] with sugar value 1. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [14, 39], [15, 40], and [14, 41], all at distance 1.0. The agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [14, 39] as it is directly north and unoccupied."
24,56,movement,[37,11],"The agent is currently at position [38,11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [37,11], [39,11], and [38,12]. Since all have the same sugar value and distance, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [37,11] as the target position to maximize welfare and minimize distance."
24,139,movement,[32,2],"All nearby positions with higher sugar values (26.0, 12.5, 22.0, 21.5) are occupied. The agent's vision is 2, and the only unoccupied positions within vision have sugar value 2.0. Among these, the closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is at [32,2] with sugar 2.0 and distance 1.41. Moving there maximizes welfare given constraints."
24,129,movement,[28,10],"The agent is currently at position [28,8] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with the highest sugar value available and unoccupied are at distance 2.0 or more with sugar value 3.0, specifically positions [28,10], [30,9], and [29,10]. Among these, the closest is [28,10] at distance 2.0. Moving there maximizes welfare by moving to the highest sugar value position within vision and unoccupied."
24,31,movement,[15,36],"The agent is currently at position [16, 36] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have sugar values of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [15, 36] and [17, 36]. Both are unoccupied and have the highest sugar value available within vision. The agent will move to the closest such position, choosing [15, 36]."
24,119,movement,[35,6],"The agent is currently at position [36,6] with sugar 1. Nearby visible positions with maximum sugar value of 3.0 are at distances 1.0 to 5.1. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [35,6] at distance 1.0 and [36,4] at distance 2.0. However, [35,6] is unoccupied and closer than [36,4]. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,6] to maximize welfare while moving the shortest distance."

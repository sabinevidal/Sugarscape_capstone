18,105,movement,[14,39],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The maximum sugar value available in these positions is 4.0, found at positions [14,39], [15,39], [15,40], and [14,41]. Among these, [14,39] is the closest with a distance of 2.24. Therefore, the agent moves to [14,39] to maximize its welfare."
18,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have sugar value 0, which is not better than the current position's sugar value of 0. Therefore, moving does not increase welfare."
18,59,movement,[18,41],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The maximum sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [18,41], [15,39], and [15,40]. Among these, [18,41] is the closest at a distance of 3.0. Therefore, the agent moves to [18,41] to maximize its welfare."
18,50,movement,[14,43],"The agent is currently at position [11, 43] with sugar value 1.0. The agent's vision is 5, and it can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar values up to 4.0. The nearest positions with the maximum sugar value of 4.0 are at [14, 43] (distance 3.0) and [14, 41] (distance 3.61). Both positions are unoccupied and within vision range. The agent will move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value, which is [14, 43]."
18,14,movement,[15,35],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The closest position with maximum sugar is [15, 35] at distance 1.0, which is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare."
18,58,movement,[31,10],"The agent is currently at position [33,10] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with higher sugar value (3.0) are available at distances 2.0 to 3.0, and these positions are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0, which is at distance 2.0. Among these, position [31,10] is one such position with sugar 3.0 and distance 2.0, and it is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent moves to [31,10]."
18,57,movement,[14,41],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [14, 41] and [15, 40]. Among these, [14, 41] is closer (distance 3.16) compared to [15, 40] (distance 4.47). Therefore, the agent moves to [14, 41] to maximize welfare while minimizing travel distance."
18,90,movement,[15,39],"The agent is currently at position [10, 38] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 6. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4 at position [15, 39]. However, this position is at distance 5.1 and is unoccupied. The agent will move to this position to maximize its welfare by collecting the highest available sugar within its vision."
18,101,movement,[37,9],"The agent is currently at position [32,9] with sugar value 4.0. Nearby positions with the highest sugar value of 4.0 are at the current position and at [37,9]. However, [37,9] is within vision range and unoccupied, so moving there would maximize welfare by maintaining the highest sugar value and potentially accessing more resources. The distance to [37,9] is 5, which is within the agent's vision of 6. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,9]."
18,31,movement,[15,40],"The agent is currently at position [11, 41] with sugar 42. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4.0 at position [15, 40], which is unoccupied and within vision range. All other positions have sugar values of 3.0 or less. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 40] to maximize welfare."
18,104,movement,[13,33],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some farther ones with lower sugar values. Among the positions with sugar value 3.0, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0 from the agent's current position (13,34). These positions are (13,33), (12,34), and (13,35). Since all have equal sugar and equal distance, moving to any of these is equally beneficial. Choosing (13,33) as the target position for movement."
18,81,movement,[33,6],"The agent is currently at position [34,6] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 5, and it can see multiple positions with sugar value 3 within distance 1 to 3.61. All these positions with sugar value 3 are unoccupied. Since the agent should move to the nearest position with maximum welfare, it will choose one of the positions with sugar value 3 at distance 1, which are [33,6] or [35,6]. Both have the same sugar value and distance, so the agent can move to either. Choosing [33,6] arbitrarily."
18,71,movement,[23,33],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [23,33] and [24,34]. Choosing to move to [23,33] as it is the first found nearest position with maximum welfare."
18,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
18,60,movement,[32,9],"The agent is currently at position [33,9] with sugar 43. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are those with sugar 4.0 at positions [32,9], [36,12], and [37,11]. Among these, [32,9] is the closest (distance 1.0) and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent will move to [32,9] to maximize welfare."
18,46,movement,[17,41],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible range. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.41. Choosing to move to position [17,41] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
18,46,reproduction,[24],"Agent 46 is male, age 19, with sugar 38.5 which is above the minimum required 21.0 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 24, who is female, age 18, with sugar 37.0. Both agents have empty neighboring positions (agent 46 has [17,40] and [17,42], agent 24 has [16,40], [15,41], and [16,42]), satisfying the condition for reproduction. Since max_partners is 1, agent 24 is selected as the partner for reproduction."
18,11,movement,[35,3],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distances 1.41 and 2.0. The closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [35,3], [33,5], and [35,5], all at distance 1.41. Since these positions are unoccupied, the agent will move to one of these positions. Choosing [35,3] as it is adjacent and has maximum sugar value."

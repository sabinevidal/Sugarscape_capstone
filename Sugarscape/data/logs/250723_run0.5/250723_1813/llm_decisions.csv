36,131,movement,[15,35],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [15,35] and [14,36]. Both are unoccupied and at distances 1.41 and 2.0 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [15,35]. Moving there maximizes welfare by collecting the highest sugar nearby."
36,57,movement,[21,39],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0, such as [21,39]. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [21,39]."
36,103,movement,[36,15],"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is at [36,15] with sugar 3.0 and distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,15]."
36,110,movement,[41,9],"The agent is currently at position [41,8] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values mostly 3.0 or 2.0. The highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions within vision is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 to 1.41, specifically positions [41,9], [40,9], and [42,9]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [41,9]."
36,67,movement,[9,39],"The agent is currently at position [9, 40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances ranging from 1.0 to 5.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [9, 39] and [9, 41], both at distance 1.0 and unoccupied. Choosing [9, 39] as the target position to move to maximize welfare while minimizing distance."
36,88,movement,[16,37],"The agent is currently at position [15, 37] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except some with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 to 4.12. The closest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0 is at [16, 37] (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 37] to maximize welfare."
36,52,movement,[38,6],"The agent is currently at position [39,7] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions all have a sugar value of 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are [38,6] and [38,8], both at a distance of approximately 1.41. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum welfare, which is [38,6]."
36,52,reproduction,[66],"Agent 52 is male, age 37, with sufficient sugar (73.0) above the minimum required for reproduction (8.0). There is one eligible partner, agent 66, who is female, age 36, within vision range, fertile, and has empty nearby positions. Both agents have empty neighboring sites, satisfying the reproduction conditions. Since max_partners is 4 and only one eligible partner is available, agent 66 is selected for reproduction."
36,5,movement,[15,39],"The agent is currently at position [15,40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. All positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and at distances ranging from 1.0 to 6.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [15,39] and [14,40], both at distance 1.0. The agent will move to one of these nearest positions with maximum sugar value to maximize welfare."
36,120,movement,[30,10],"The agent is currently at position [32,10] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 3. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are at distances 2.0 to 3.16. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 3 is [30,10] at distance 2.0. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while minimizing movement distance."
36,107,movement,[29,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [29,2], [31,2], and [30,3] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions is equally beneficial. Choosing to move to [29,2] arbitrarily."
36,135,movement,[33,4],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the position [33,4] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is within vision range (distance 2.0). Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other positions with sugar values of 2.0 or less. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,4]."
36,46,movement,[15,43],"The agent is currently at position [14, 43] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available nearby. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [15, 43] and [14, 44]. The agent will move to the closest position with maximum sugar value, choosing [15, 43]."
36,59,movement,[10,36],"The agent is currently at position [9,37] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances ranging from 1.41 to 4.12. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [10,36], [8,38], [10,35], [11,36], and [11,38] all at distance 1.41 or 2.24. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [10,36]."
36,8,movement,[30,9],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Among these positions with sugar value 3.0, the closest one is at position [30,9] with a distance of 1.0. Therefore, the agent moves to [30,9] to maximize its welfare."
36,156,movement,[40,9],"The agent is currently at position [39,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [40,9], [38,8], and [40,10], all at distances less than or equal to 1.41. The agent chooses to move to [40,9] as it is the closest position with maximum sugar value and is unoccupied."
36,106,movement,[13,39],"The agent is currently at position [14, 38] with sugar 1.0. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0. Among these, the closest positions are [13, 39] at distance 1.41 and [14, 36] at distance 2.0. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [13, 39]."
36,106,reproduction,[96],"Agent 106 is male, age 18, with sugar 38.5 which is above the minimum required 17.5 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 96, who is female, age 37, with sugar 21.5. Both have empty neighboring sites (agent 106 has three empty nearby positions and agent 96 has two). Since the partner is within vision range and fertile, and both have empty adjacent sites, reproduction is possible. Agent 106 can reproduce with up to 2 partners but only one eligible partner is available. Therefore, agent 96 is selected for reproduction."
36,134,movement,[35,7],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, with the highest sugar value being 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distances 1.41 to 2.24. The nearest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0 is at [35,7] with distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,7]."
36,123,movement,[30,2],"The agent can only see positions [30,1] and [30,2] within its vision range. Position [30,1] is currently occupied by the agent itself and has sugar value 1.0. Position [30,2] is unoccupied and also has sugar value 1.0. Since both positions have the same sugar value, the agent will move to the nearest unoccupied position with maximum welfare, which is [30,2]."
36,122,movement,[10,43],"The agent is currently at position [10, 42] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [10, 43], [9, 41], [9, 43], and [11, 43]. All are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. Choosing the closest one, [10, 43], which is at distance 1.0, maximizes welfare and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [10, 43]."

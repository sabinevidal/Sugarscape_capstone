27,118,movement,[17,40],"The agent is currently at position [18, 42] with sugar 17.5. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 4.0 at positions [17, 40], [15, 42], [15, 43], and [14, 42]. The nearest of these is [17, 40] at a distance of 2.24. Moving there maximizes welfare by moving to the highest sugar value position closest to the agent."
27,81,movement,[30,12],"The agent is currently at position [29,12] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances 1.0 to 3.61. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are [30,12] and [29,13], both at distance 1.0 and unoccupied. The agent will move to one of these positions to maximize welfare and minimize movement distance. Choosing [30,12] arbitrarily among the nearest maximum sugar positions."
27,75,movement,[28,2],"All adjacent positions have equal sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing position [28,2] arbitrarily among the options."
27,75,reproduction,[42],"Agent 75 is female, has vision 1, and sugar 19.5 which is above the minimum 17.0 for reproduction. There are two eligible male partners within vision: agent 42 and agent 74. Both have empty nearby positions for their offspring. Agent 42 has 35 sugar, agent 74 has 26 sugar. Agent 42 has slightly more sugar and more empty nearby positions for offspring, making reproduction more likely to succeed. Since max partners is 1, agent 42 is chosen as the partner for reproduction."
27,93,movement,[32,4],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less. The maximum sugar value available is 3.0, and there are multiple positions with this value at a distance of 1 or approximately 1.41. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, I select position [32,4] which is unoccupied and has sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0."
27,17,movement,[10,30],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the positions [10, 30], [12, 30], and [11, 31] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. All are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to [10, 30] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare."
27,90,movement,[15,42],"The agent is currently at position [18, 40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [15, 42], [15, 43], and [14, 42]. These positions are unoccupied and within vision. The nearest of these is [15, 42] at a distance of 3.61, which is the closest position with maximum sugar value. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 42] to maximize welfare."
27,120,movement,[31,13],"The agent is currently at position [31,12] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. The agent chooses to move to the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value, which is [31,13] at distance 1.0."
27,80,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [29,7] with sugar 58.0. Nearby positions with higher sugar values are occupied. The visible unoccupied positions have sugar values of 3.0 or less, which is less than the current position's sugar value. Therefore, moving would not increase welfare."
27,52,movement,[31,7],"The agent is currently at position [32,7] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision have sugar values mostly 3 or 2, but all positions with sugar value 3 are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value available are those with sugar value 2 at distance 1.0, specifically positions [31,7], [33,7], and [32,8]. Among these, all are at the same distance and sugar value, so the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [31,7] arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision."
27,124,movement,[31,6],"The agent is currently at position [29,6] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0. These positions are [31,6], [32,6], [30,9], [33,6], [33,5], [28,10], [33,4], [31,10], [30,11], and [35,6]. All these positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The agent should move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value. The distances to these positions are: [31,6] (2.0), [32,6] (3.0), [30,9] (3.16), [33,6] (4.0), [33,5] (4.12), [28,10] (4.12), [33,4] (4.47), [31,10] (4.47), [30,11] (5.1), [35,6] (6.0). The nearest position with maximum sugar is [31,6] at distance 2.0. This position is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [31,6]."
27,122,movement,[14,42],"The agent is currently at position [13, 38] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are [14, 42] with sugar 4, and [57] at [13, 42] with sugar 37 (occupied). Since [13, 42] is occupied, the agent cannot move there. The next best unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [14, 42] with sugar 4, which is within vision range and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 42] to maximize welfare."
27,26,movement,[40,6],"The agent is currently at position [39,6] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [40,6], [38,5], [40,5], and [40,7], each with sugar value 3.0. These positions are within vision range and unoccupied. Among these, the closest is [40,6] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [40,6] to maximize welfare."
27,58,movement,[28,10],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [28,10] and [30,9]. Among these, [28,10] is closer (distance 1.0) compared to [30,9] (distance 2.0). Therefore, the agent will move to [28,10]."
27,126,movement,[11,36],"The agent is currently at position [11, 37] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. However, all positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [11, 36], [10, 37], and [12, 37]. Since all these positions have the same sugar value and distance, the agent can move to any of them. Choosing [11, 36] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
27,46,movement,[15,37],"The agent is currently at position [16,37] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0, but all positions with sugar 3.0 are occupied or not reachable (occupied positions include many around the agent). The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [15,37], [15,36], [17,36], and [17,38], all at distance 1.0 to 1.41 and unoccupied. Choosing the nearest position with maximum welfare, the agent will move to [15,37]."
27,72,movement,[35,10],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [35,10] and [36,11]. Both are unoccupied and equally close. Choosing [35,10] arbitrarily as the target position to maximize welfare."
27,102,movement,[15,43],"The agent is currently at position [11, 42]. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at position [15, 43], which is unoccupied and within vision range. This position offers the maximum welfare compared to other unoccupied positions with sugar values mostly at 3.0 or less. The agent should move to [15, 43] to maximize sugar intake."

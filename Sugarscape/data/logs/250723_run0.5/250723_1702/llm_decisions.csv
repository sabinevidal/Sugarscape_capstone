20,53,reproduction,[12],"Agent 53 is female, age 21, with sugar 28 which is above the minimum required 20 for reproduction. There is one eligible partner, agent 12, who is male, age 20, with sugar 24. Both have empty neighboring positions (agent 53 has [36,5],[35,6] and agent 12 has [37,7],[36,8]), so reproduction is possible. Since max_partners is 1, agent 12 is selected as the partner for reproduction."
20,23,movement,[37,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [37,3] and [37,5] have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is equally good. Choosing to move to [37,3]."
20,13,movement,[16,36],"The agent is currently at position [16,37] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0 or 1.41, which are the nearest maximum welfare positions. The agent can move to any of these positions. Choosing position [16,36] which is at distance 1.0 and has sugar value 3.0, as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
20,71,movement,[22,32],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [22,32] and [23,33]. Choosing the closest position with maximum welfare, the agent will move to [22,32]."
20,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
20,108,movement,[34,11],"The agent is currently at position [35,11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 to 2.24. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [34,11] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,11] to maximize welfare."
20,111,movement,[37,5],"Among the visible positions, [37,5] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. It is within vision range and closer than other positions with lower sugar values. Moving there maximizes welfare."
20,59,movement,[12,38],"The agent is currently at position [14, 40] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 5, and it can see several unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 at distances ranging from 2.83 to 5. The agent should move to the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value to maximize welfare. The closest such positions with sugar value 3 are at [12, 38] and [12, 42], both at distance 2.83. Choosing [12, 38] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
20,59,reproduction,[67,57],"Agent 59 is male, age 21, with sugar 33.0, which is above the minimum sugar required for reproduction (12.0). There are two eligible female partners within vision: Agent 67 (age 20, sugar 48.0) and Agent 57 (age 21, sugar 31.5). Both partners have empty neighboring positions available for placing offspring, and Agent 59 also has empty neighboring positions. Since the agent can reproduce with up to 2 partners and both meet all criteria (opposite sex, fertile, within vision, and empty adjacent sites), it is optimal to reproduce with both to maximize offspring. Therefore, Agent 59 should reproduce with both partners 67 and 57."
20,72,movement,[32,12],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. However, the current position is occupied by the agent itself, so it can move to a position with sugar value 3.0. Among the visible positions with sugar value 3.0, the nearest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0 (positions [32,12], [32,11], [32,13], [34,13]). All these positions have the same sugar value and are unoccupied. Choosing the closest one with the lowest distance, position [32,12] is selected for movement."
20,96,movement,[11,37],"The agent is currently at position [13, 39] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [11, 37], [13, 36], [10, 39], [10, 38], [10, 40], [12, 42], [11, 36], [15, 36], [10, 37], [10, 41], [11, 42], [13, 35], [9, 39], [12, 35], [9, 38], [9, 40], [8, 39], and [13, 44]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [11, 37] (distance 2.83), [13, 36] (distance 3.0), and [10, 39] (distance 3.0). The nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar) is [11, 37]. Therefore, the agent should move to [11, 37]."
20,67,movement,[10,38],"The agent is currently at position [11, 38] with sugar value 1.0. All adjacent positions with higher sugar values (3.0) are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1 or approximately 1.41, such as [10, 38], [10, 37], and [10, 39]. Among these, [10, 38] is the closest and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [10, 38] to maximize welfare."
20,12,movement,[34,6],"The agent is currently at position [36,7] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are those with sugar value 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied position with sugar value 3.0 is [34,6], which is at a distance of 2.24. Moving there will maximize the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,6]."
20,85,movement,[37,12],"The agent is currently at position [37,10] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 2.0 to 4.47. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [39,10], [37,12], and [38,8] at distance 2.0. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [37,12]."
20,85,reproduction,[15],"The agent 85 is male, age 21, with sugar 9.5 which is above the minimum sugar required for reproduction (7.0). There is one eligible partner, agent 15, who is female, age 21, with sugar 20.5. Both have empty neighboring positions available for placing a child (agent 85 has positions [37,11],[36,12],[38,12] and agent 15 has positions [36,13],[38,13],[37,14]). Since the max partners is 1 and the partner meets all criteria (opposite sex, fertile, within vision, and empty adjacent site), reproduction will occur with partner 15."
20,115,movement,[30,10],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 2.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0, such as (30,10) and (31,11). Both are unoccupied. Choosing (30,10) as it is the first found with max sugar and nearest."
20,7,movement,[17,32],"All adjacent positions have the same sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing to move to position [17, 32] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value."
20,58,movement,[31,8],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 except for positions [32,9] and [31,10] which have sugar value 2.0, and the current position [31,9] which has sugar value 1.0. None of the visible positions with sugar 3.0 are occupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar, [31,8] or [30,9], both at distance 1.0 and sugar 3.0. Moving to [31,8] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
20,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."

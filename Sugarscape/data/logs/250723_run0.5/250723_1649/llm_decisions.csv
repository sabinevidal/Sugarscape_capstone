16,60,movement,[36,6],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [36,6], [35,7], and [37,7]. These positions are unoccupied and provide maximum welfare within vision. Choosing the closest among them, [36,6] is selected for movement."
16,100,movement,[17,42],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the highest sugar value available is 4.0 at position [17, 42]. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by allowing it to collect the maximum sugar available nearby."
16,42,movement,[26,3],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value (2.0) are at distance 1.0. Among these, moving to any of these positions yields the same welfare. Choosing to move to position [26,3] which is directly north and at distance 1.0."
16,2,movement,[14,38],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 2.0, specifically [14,38] and [14,42]. The agent chooses to move to [14,38] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar and is unoccupied."
16,27,movement,[27,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, positions [27,2], [29,2], and [28,3] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions would maximize welfare. Choosing [27,2] arbitrarily among them."
16,57,movement,[12,42],"The agent is currently at position [13, 41] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, but all these positions are unoccupied and at various distances. The nearest positions with sugar value 3 are at distances approximately 1.41 to 2.83. Among these, position [12, 42] is at distance 1.41 and has sugar value 3, which is the maximum welfare available nearby and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [12, 42] to maximize welfare."
16,5,movement,[16,36],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0: [16,36], [15,37], and [17,37]. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these is equally beneficial. Choosing to move to [16,36]."
16,80,movement,[35,7],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 to 3.16. Among these, position [35,7] is the closest with sugar value 3.0 and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare and is the nearest such position."
16,66,movement,[38,4],"The agent is currently at position [36,4] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 4. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0. These positions are [38,4], [34,3], [34,5], [38,5], [37,6], [34,6], [39,4], [39,5], [37,7]. All these positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, so the agent should move to the nearest one. The distances to these positions are: [38,4] (2.0), [34,3] (2.24), [34,5] (2.24), [38,5] (2.24), [37,6] (2.24), [34,6] (2.83), [39,4] (3.0), [39,5] (3.16), [37,7] (3.16). The nearest position with maximum sugar value is [38,4] at distance 2.0. This position is unoccupied, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
16,46,movement,[16,39],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with lower values. The agent is currently at position [16, 38] with sugar 1.0. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Among these, position [16, 39] is the closest with sugar 3.0 and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 39] to maximize welfare."
16,75,movement,[30,1],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [30,1], [32,1], and [31,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. All are at equal distance (1 unit) from the agent's current position. The agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [30,1] arbitrarily among these equally optimal options."
16,38,movement,[37,6],"The agent has a vision of 2 and sees several unoccupied positions with sugar values. The maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [37,6], [34,5], and [38,5]. Among these, [37,6] is the closest with a distance of 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,6] to maximize welfare."
16,85,movement,[37,7],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [37,7] and [38,9]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar, the agent moves to [37,7]."
16,54,movement,[15,42],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [15,42] and [15,44]. Choosing to move to [15,42] as it is the first nearest position with maximum sugar value."
16,96,movement,[14,35],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0. The agent is currently at position [14,36] with sugar value 1.0. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. Among these, positions [14,35], [13,36], and [15,37] are unoccupied and have sugar 3.0. The closest is at distance 1.0, so the agent will move to [14,35]."
16,26,movement,[39,5],"Among the visible positions, several have the maximum sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest position with maximum sugar is [39,5] at distance 1.0, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
16,11,movement,[34,3],"Among the visible positions, the position [34,3] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. It is also within the agent's vision range (distance 1.0). Moving there maximizes welfare."
16,72,movement,[37,13],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [37,13] and [36,14]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [37,13] as the target position to maximize welfare and minimize movement distance."
16,12,movement,[34,5],"The agent is currently at position [35,5] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0 at positions [34,5], [34,6], and [33,6], all within vision range and unoccupied. Among these, [34,5] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [34,5] to maximize welfare."

Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is at [19,40] with sugar 3.0 and distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [19,40]."
16,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."

11,38,movement,[37,8],"The agent is currently at position [37,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0 at positions [37,8], [36,9], [38,8], and [38,10]. All these positions are at distance 1 or approximately 1.41. The nearest positions with maximum sugar are [37,8] and [36,9] at distance 1. The agent will move to [37,8] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (sugar value 3.0) and unoccupied."
11,26,movement,[41,8],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, those at [41,8], [41,7], [41,9], [40,8], and [42,10] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. All these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value (3.0) are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The closest is at distance 1.0, position [41,8]. Therefore, the agent should move to [41,8] to maximize welfare."
12,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, which is not better than the current position's sugar value of 0. Therefore, moving would not increase welfare."
12,20,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
12,10,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [39, 45] with sugar value 0.0. Among all visible positions within vision range, the position [39, 1] has the highest sugar value of 2.0, but it is at a distance of 44.0, which is beyond the agent's vision range of 6. Therefore, the agent cannot move there. All other visible positions within vision range have sugar value 0.0, so there is no better position to move to. Hence, the agent will not move."
12,52,movement,[32,10],"The agent is currently at position [30,9] with sugar 34. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar values up to 4. The nearest positions with the maximum sugar value of 4 within vision are at distances 2.24 to 6.0. Among these, the closest position with sugar 4 is [32,10] at distance 2.24, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [32,10] to maximize welfare."
12,67,movement,[12,39],"The agent is currently at position [13, 39]. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4.0, but many of these positions are occupied or farther away. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar value 4.0 are [13, 38] and [12, 39], both at distance 1.0. Choosing [12, 39] as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare at the nearest distance."
12,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, which is not better than the current position's sugar value of 0.0. Therefore, there is no benefit in moving to any other position."
12,42,movement,[25,6],"All visible positions within vision range have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent can move to any of these positions. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Moving to position [25,6] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value."
12,80,movement,[34,9],"The agent is currently at position [35,9] with sugar 1. The visible positions within vision have sugar values mostly 4 or 3, with no higher sugar values available. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value 4 are at distances 1 or 2. The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with sugar 4, which is [34,9], as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision range."
12,40,movement,[18,39],"The agent is currently at position [19, 38] with sugar 15. The agent's vision is 5, and it can see multiple positions with sugar values up to 4. The highest sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 4, found at positions [18, 39], [17, 40], and [16, 37]. Among these, [18, 39] is the closest with a distance of 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [18, 39] to maximize welfare."
12,90,movement,[12,41],"The agent is currently at position [13, 41] with sugar 24. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 4 or 3, with some at distance 1. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value that is unoccupied. Positions [12, 41] and [13, 42] both have sugar value 4 and are at distance 1, and are unoccupied. Choosing [12, 41] as the target position to move to, as it is the nearest with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
12,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
12,87,movement,[21,36],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [21,36] and [20,37] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are at distance 1, so the agent can move to either. Choosing [21,36] arbitrarily as it provides maximum welfare."
12,96,movement,[16,37],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are unoccupied. The maximum sugar value available in these positions is 4.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 4.0 are at distances 1.41 and 2.0. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at position [16, 37] with sugar 4.0 and distance 1.41. This position is unoccupied and provides the best welfare improvement."
12,55,movement,[33,4],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 3.0 at positions [33,4], [35,3], and [32,5]. Among these, [33,4] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent moves to [33,4] to maximize welfare."
12,13,movement,[17,40],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The maximum sugar value visible in unoccupied positions is 4. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 4 are at distance 1 (positions [17,40] and [17,42]). Since both have the same sugar value and distance, the agent can move to either. Choosing [17,40] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
12,24,movement,[13,38],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 4.0, and the nearest positions with this value are at distances 2.24 to 3.61. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 4.0 are at [13,38] and [13,42], both at distance 2.24. Choosing the closest one, [13,38], the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
12,75,movement,[32,1],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [32,1], [34,1], and [33,2] all have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally near (distance 1) and have the same sugar value, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [32,1] arbitrarily among these options."
12,50,movement,[15,43],"The agent is currently at position [14, 43] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0, available at multiple positions: [15, 43], [13, 42], [16, 42], and [17, 42]. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest positions with sugar 4.0 are [15, 43] and [13, 42], both at distance 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The closest is [15, 43] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 43] to maximize welfare."

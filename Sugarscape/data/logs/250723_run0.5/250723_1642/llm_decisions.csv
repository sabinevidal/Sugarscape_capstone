13,26,movement,[41,6],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 and the current position with 1.0. Among the positions with sugar value 3.0, the closest ones are at distance 1.0: [41,6] and [40,7]. Both are unoccupied and equally good in terms of sugar value and distance. Choosing [41,6] arbitrarily as the target position to maximize welfare."
13,88,movement,[11,40],"The agent is currently at position [12,40] with sugar 1.0. The visible positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 3.0, but many of these positions are unoccupied. Since the agent should move to the nearest position with maximum welfare (maximum sugar), it will choose one of the closest positions with sugar 3.0. The closest such positions are at distance 1.0 or 2.24. Among these, position [11,40] is at distance 1.0 and has sugar 3.0, and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent will move to [11,40]."
13,12,movement,[34,6],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The closest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar, the agent will move to position [34,6] which is unoccupied and has sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0."
13,95,movement,[39,10],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. The position [39,10] is unoccupied and has sugar 3.0 at distance 1.0, which is the nearest maximum welfare position. Therefore, the agent should move to [39,10]."
13,93,movement,[30,7],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [30,7] and [29,8]. Both are unoccupied. Moving to either will maximize welfare. Choosing [30,7] arbitrarily among the nearest max sugar positions."
14,70,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
14,87,movement,[20,35],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [20, 35] and [19, 36] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at the same distance (1.0) from the agent's current position. Choosing to move to [20, 35] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare (highest sugar)."
14,81,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [31,4] with sugar 46. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 2, which are lower than the agent's current sugar. Moving to any of these positions would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."
14,96,movement,[14,37],"The agent is currently at position [15, 37] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 4 or 3, but many of the positions with sugar 4 are occupied or out of reach. The nearest unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value (4) are at [14, 37] and [15, 38], both at distance 1. The agent chooses to move to [14, 37] as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare (sugar value 4) at the nearest distance."
14,39,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have a sugar value of 0.0, so there is no benefit in moving. The agent will stay in its current position."
14,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
14,58,movement,[33,8],"The agent is currently at position [33,6] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [33,8] with sugar 4.0 and within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare as it has the highest sugar value among visible unoccupied positions."
14,5,movement,[15,38],"The agent is currently at position [17, 35] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar values up to 4. The highest sugar value visible in unoccupied positions is 4, at positions [15, 38] and [15, 39]. Both are at distances 3.61 and 4.47 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 4 is [15, 38]. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 38] to maximize welfare."
14,15,movement,[34,11],"The agent is currently at position [33,10] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 4, and it can see multiple positions with sugar values higher than 1. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4 at positions [34,11] and [36,11]. Both are at distances 1.41 and 3.16 respectively. The nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar) is [34,11]. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,11]."

The closest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [19,37] and [21,37]. Both are unoccupied and equally good. Choosing to move to [19,37] as it is the first found with maximum sugar value and minimum distance."
14,38,movement,[37,5],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same maximum sugar value of 3.0. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [37,5] and [38,6]. Choosing [37,5] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
14,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have sugar value 0, which is not better than the current position's sugar value of 0. Therefore, moving does not increase welfare."
14,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
14,30,movement,[9,38],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to position [9,38], which is unoccupied and has sugar value 3.0, to maximize welfare."

Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at position [15, 39], which is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare as it provides the maximum sugar value available nearby."

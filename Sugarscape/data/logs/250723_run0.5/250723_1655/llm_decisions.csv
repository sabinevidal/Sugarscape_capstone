18,12,movement,[36,4],"The agent is currently at position [35,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [36,4] and [35,5], both at distance 1.0. Choosing [36,4] as the target position to move to, as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision range."
18,95,movement,[40,10],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0 from the agent's current position (40,11). Choosing one of these closest positions to maximize welfare and minimize movement cost, the agent will move to (40,10)."
18,26,movement,[40,5],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0 at positions [40,5] and [39,6]. Both are within vision range, but [40,5] is closer (distance 1.41) compared to [39,6] (distance 2.0). Therefore, the agent moves to [40,5] to maximize welfare."
18,80,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [34,12] with sugar 46.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is less than the current position's sugar value. Therefore, moving would not increase the agent's welfare. The agent should stay in place to maximize welfare."
18,37,movement,[39,9],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Among these, position [39,9] is unoccupied and closest with sugar 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare."
18,37,reproduction,[56],"Agent 37 is female, age 19, with sugar 15, which is above the minimum required for reproduction (5). The eligible partner is agent 56, male, age 18, with sugar 19. Both have empty neighboring positions (agent 37 has three empty spots, and agent 56 has two). Since agent 37 can reproduce with up to 2 partners and only one eligible partner is available, reproduction with agent 56 is chosen. This ensures continuation of lineage and efficient use of resources."
18,93,movement,[30,5],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0. Among these, the agent can move to any of the positions [30,5], [31,6], [30,7] which are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value. Choosing [30,5] as it is directly adjacent and has maximum sugar value."
18,27,movement,[28,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [28,1], [29,2], and [28,3] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [28,1] arbitrarily among them."
18,69,movement,[17,35],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with lower values. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [17,35] and [19,35]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [17,35] as the target position to move to maximize welfare."
18,29,movement,[38,12],"The agent is currently at position [37,12] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [38,12], [38,11], and [38,13], all at distance 1.0 or 1.41. Since [38,12] is the closest with maximum sugar and unoccupied, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
18,17,movement,[11,30],"Among the visible positions within vision range, positions [11, 30] and [10, 31] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since both are equally good in terms of sugar value and distance, moving to [11, 30] is chosen arbitrarily as it is to the right of the current position."
18,56,movement,[37,8],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.41: (37,8) and (39,8). Choosing (37,8) as it is the first found nearest position with maximum sugar."
18,96,movement,[13,34],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. All unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. The agent chooses the nearest position with this maximum sugar value, which is at position [13,34] with a distance of 1.0."
18,40,movement,[12,37],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [12,37], [11,38], and [13,38]. Choosing [12,37] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
18,66,movement,[39,6],"The agent is currently at position [39,3] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions within vision have sugar values mostly 2 or 3, but some of these positions are occupied. The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. Positions [39,6] and [40,6] have sugar value 3 and are unoccupied, but are at distances 3.0 and 3.16 respectively. Positions with sugar value 2 are closer but have lower sugar value. Therefore, the agent moves to [39,6], which is the nearest position with the maximum sugar value available within vision and unoccupied."
18,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
18,74,movement,[29,2],"The agent can see two unoccupied positions within its vision: [29,2] with sugar value 2.0 and [29,1] which is its current position with sugar value 1.0. The position [29,2] has the highest sugar value and is unoccupied, so moving there maximizes welfare."
18,38,movement,[36,5],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [36,5] and [35,5] have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at distances 1 and 2 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [36,5] at distance 1, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
18,38,reproduction,[12],"Agent 38 is female, age 19, with sugar 55 which is above the minimum required 17 for reproduction. The eligible partner is agent 12, male, age 19, with sugar 30. Both have empty neighboring sites (agent 38 has three empty nearby positions and agent 12 has two). Since agent 38 can reproduce with up to 2 partners and only one eligible partner is available who meets all criteria, reproduction with agent 12 is chosen. This ensures continuation of lineage and efficient use of resources."
18,55,movement,[32,4],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Among these positions, the closest ones with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.41 and 2.0. The agent chooses to move to position [32,4], which has sugar value 3.0 and is the nearest position with maximum welfare (distance 1.41)."
18,53,movement,[38,7],"The agent is currently at position [38,5] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. These positions are at distances ranging from 2.0 to 6.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [38,7] at distance 2.0 and [40,6] and [39,7] at distance approximately 2.24. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [38,7]."
18,7,movement,[16,33],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [16, 33] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare."
18,24,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is significantly lower than the sugar values of occupied neighboring positions. Since the agent cannot move to occupied positions and no unoccupied position offers higher sugar, the agent should stay in place."
18,24,reproduction,[46],"Agent 24 is female, age 19, with sugar 29, which is above the minimum sugar required for reproduction (14). The eligible partner is agent 46, male, age 19, with sugar 28. Both have empty neighboring positions available for placing a child (agent 24 has [16,40] and [16,42], agent 46 has [17,40] and [17,42]). Since agent 24 can reproduce with up to 2 partners and only one eligible partner is available, reproduction with agent 46 is possible and optimal. Therefore, agent 24 should reproduce with agent 46."
18,87,movement,[17,34],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position at [17, 34] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare."

20,29,movement,[40,12],"The agent is currently at position [39,12] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0, available at multiple positions such as [40,12], [40,11], [40,13], [39,10], [41,12], [39,14], etc. All these positions are unoccupied and within the agent's vision range. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is at distance 1.0 at [40,12]. Therefore, the agent should move to [40,12] to maximize welfare."
21,7,movement,[17,31],"All adjacent positions have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent can move to any of these positions. Choosing to move to position [17,31] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare."
21,5,movement,[15,36],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is lower than the agent's current sugar of 59.0. However, the agent should move to an unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision. The maximum sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [15,36] and [15,38]. Both are unoccupied and equally close. The agent will move to [15,36] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
21,101,movement,[39,6],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [39,6], [38,7], and [40,7]. Choosing the closest position with maximum welfare, I select [39,6]."
21,120,movement,[33,10],"The agent is currently at position [35,10] with sugar value 1. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [33,10], [32,11], and [34,13]. The nearest of these is [33,10] at distance 2.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,10] to maximize welfare."
21,37,movement,[39,10],"The agent is currently at position [39,11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except a few with 2.0 or 1.0. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. The closest such positions are [39,10], [40,11], [40,10], and [38,12], all at distance 1 or 1.41. Choosing the closest one, [39,10], which is unoccupied and has sugar 3.0, maximizes welfare and is nearest."
21,72,movement,[32,11],"The agent is currently at position [32,12] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [32,11] and [34,13], both with sugar value 4. Among these, [32,11] is closer (distance 1.0) compared to [34,13] (distance 2.24). Therefore, the agent will move to [32,11] to maximize welfare while minimizing distance."
21,67,movement,[10,37],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0. Since the agent's current position has a sugar value of 1.0, moving to any of these positions will increase welfare. The agent chooses to move to position [10,37], which is unoccupied and at distance 1.0, providing maximum welfare within vision."
21,81,movement,[32,8],"The agent is currently at position [33,7] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions have sugar values mostly 3 or less, but all positions with sugar value 3 are occupied. The next best unoccupied positions have sugar value 2, which are at distances 1.41 to 4.12. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 2 is at [32,8] or [34,8]. Choosing [32,8] as it is within vision and unoccupied."
21,81,reproduction,[58],"Agent 81 is female, age 22, with sugar 61, which is above the minimum sugar required for reproduction (21). There is one eligible partner, agent 58, who is male, age 21, with sugar 51, also above the minimum. Both have empty neighboring positions (agent 81 has [33,8],[32,9]; agent 58 has [31,7],[30,8],[31,9]), satisfying the condition for reproduction. Since max_partners is 2 and only one eligible partner is available, agent 58 is selected for reproduction."
21,11,movement,[33,4],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [33,4], [32,4], [34,4], [35,3], and [33,5] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. None of these positions are occupied. The closest position with maximum sugar is [33,4] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,4] to maximize welfare."
21,15,movement,[37,14],"The agent is currently at position [37,13] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 4, and it can see multiple positions with sugar value 3 at distances ranging from 1 to 4. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are [37,14], [36,12], and [38,12], all at approximately 1 to 1.41 distance. Since these positions are unoccupied, the agent will move to the nearest one with maximum sugar value, which is [37,14] at distance 1."
21,110,movement,[34,13],"The agent is currently at position [34,7] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value (4.0) within vision range are at [34,13], but it is 6 units away. There are closer positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances around 1.41 to 3.61, but these are all occupied. The closest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value is [34,13] with sugar 4.0, which is within vision range and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,13] to maximize welfare."
21,23,movement,[36,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [36,3], [36,4], and [35,3] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. All these positions are unoccupied and within vision. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [36,3] at distance 1.0, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
21,31,movement,[17,38],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [17, 38] and [18, 38]. Choosing the closest position with maximum welfare, the agent will move to [17, 38]."
21,52,movement,[34,12],"The agent is currently at position [35,12] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [34,12] and [36,12]. Both are unoccupied and equally close. The agent can move to either. Choosing [34,12] arbitrarily as the target position to maximize sugar intake."
21,75,movement,[29,3],"All adjacent positions have equal sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing position [29, 3] arbitrarily among the options."

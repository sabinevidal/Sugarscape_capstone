12,95,movement,[38,10],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The maximum sugar value available is 4.0 at multiple positions. Among these, the closest position with sugar 4.0 is at distance 1.0 at position [38,10]. This position is unoccupied and provides the maximum welfare within vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [38,10]."
12,12,movement,[34,7],"The agent is currently at position [32,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [34,7], [33,11], [35,10], and [36,9]. The nearest among these is [34,7] at distance 2.0. Since [34,7] is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value within vision, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
12,27,movement,[28,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, positions [28,1], [30,1], and [29,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [28,1] arbitrarily as the target."
12,56,movement,[35,13],"The agent is currently at position [36,13] with sugar value 1. The agent can see several unoccupied positions with sugar value 4 at distances 1.0 to 4.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 4 are at [35,13] (distance 1.0) and [35,10] (distance 3.16). Since [35,13] is the closest position with the highest sugar value, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
12,88,movement,[12,40],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [12,40]. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [12,40]."
12,17,movement,[10,35],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [10,35], [9,36], and [11,36] all have the highest sugar value of 3.0. They are all at the same distance (1.0). Choosing to move to [10,35] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare."
12,2,movement,[16,40],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the vision range. Among these, the closest unoccupied position is [16,40] at distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare while minimizing movement distance."
12,5,movement,[18,35],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0. Among these, I choose to move to position [18,35] which is directly north and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare at the nearest distance."
12,74,movement,[30,1],"The agent can see three unoccupied positions within its vision: [30,1] with sugar 2.0, [31,2] with sugar 2.0, and its current position [31,1] with sugar 1.0. Both [30,1] and [31,2] have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are at distance 1.0. The agent will move to one of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [30,1] arbitrarily as it is equally beneficial and unoccupied."
12,26,movement,[41,7],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same maximum sugar value of 3.0. The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, the agent selects position [41,7] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
12,39,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
12,71,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is the maximum welfare available. Since the agent is currently at position [28, 32] with sugar value 1.0, and moving to any other position with the same sugar value does not provide additional welfare, the agent will stay in place to avoid unnecessary movement."
12,66,movement,[35,3],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Among these positions, the closest ones with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [35,3] and [37,3]. Since both have equal sugar and distance, the agent can choose either. The agent chooses to move to [35,3] to maximize welfare by moving to the nearest position with maximum sugar value."
12,58,movement,[32,6],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0, 1.41, 2.0, 2.24, and 3.0. The closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [32,6] at distance 1.0 and [30,7] at distance 1.41. Both are unoccupied. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [32,6]."
12,30,movement,[11,38],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision range. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [11,38] and [10,39]. Choosing [11,38] as it is directly adjacent and thus minimal movement cost."
12,37,movement,[36,9],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value among unoccupied positions within vision is 4.0 at position [36,9]. This position is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by moving to the position with the highest sugar available nearby."
12,73,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, and the current position is also producing 1.0 sugar. Since moving does not provide any increase in welfare and all nearby positions are unoccupied with equal sugar, the agent will stay in place to conserve energy."
12,72,movement,[35,10],"The agent is currently at position [36,10] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [35,10] and [33,11], both with sugar value 4. Among these, [35,10] is closer (distance 1) compared to [33,11] (distance 3.16). Therefore, the agent should move to [35,10] to maximize welfare."
12,46,movement,[14,35],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions are [14,35], [13,36], [15,35], [13,37], and [15,37]. Choosing the closest one at distance 1.0, position [14,35] is selected for movement to maximize welfare."
12,11,movement,[35,5],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the positions [35,5] and [35,6] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are unoccupied and within vision. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [35,5] at distance 1.0, which is closer than [35,6] at distance 2.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,5] to maximize welfare."
12,15,movement,[33,11],"The agent is currently at position [30, 11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at position [33, 11], which is within the agent's vision range (distance 3.0). Moving there maximizes welfare as it provides the highest sugar value nearby. The positions with sugar value 3.0 are closer but have lower sugar value than 4.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [33, 11]."
12,84,movement,[29,12],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0 from the agent's current position. Among these, the agent can move to any of the positions [29,12], [30,13], [29,11], or [29,13]. Choosing [29,12] as it is the first in the list and equally optimal."
12,31,movement,[9,42],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [9,42] and [10,43]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [9,42] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
12,38,movement,[37,7],"The agent is currently at position [37,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have sugar values of 3.0 except for [37,9] with 2.0 and [35,8] with 1.0. The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value, which is 3.0. The closest such positions are [37,7] and [38,8], both at distance 1.0. The agent can choose either; here, it moves to [37,7]."
12,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
12,53,movement,[36,6],"The agent is currently at position [36,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [36,6]. This position is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value available. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,6]."
12,60,movement,[34,8],"The agent is currently at position [36,8] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, but all these positions are unoccupied and at a distance of 2 or more. Since the agent should move to the nearest position with maximum welfare (maximum sugar value), it will move to one of the positions with sugar value 3 at distance 2. Among these, [34,8] is chosen arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and has maximum sugar value within vision range."
13,85,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [35,7] with sugar 12. The visible positions within vision range that are unoccupied have a maximum sugar value of 4. Since 4 is less than the current position's sugar value of 12, moving would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."

16,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have sugar value 0 except the current position which also has sugar value 0. There are no unoccupied positions with higher sugar value within vision. Therefore, the agent should not move."
16,37,movement,[38,10],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [38,10] and [35,13]. Among these, [38,10] is closer (distance 2.24) compared to [35,13] (distance 4.12). Therefore, the agent moves to [38,10] to maximize welfare by collecting the highest sugar at the nearest position."
16,84,movement,[32,10],"The agent is currently at position [31,10] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are [32,10] and [33,11], both with sugar value 4. Among these, [32,10] is closer (distance 1.0) compared to [33,11] (distance 2.24). The position [32,10] is unoccupied, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
16,53,movement,[38,6],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The agent should move to the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value, which is 3.0. The closest such positions are at distance 1.0: [38,6], [37,7], and [39,7]. Any of these positions are equally good. Choosing [38,6] as the move target."
16,24,movement,[17,40],"The agent is currently at position [17, 41] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to 6 units away. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0, found at positions [17, 40], [17, 42], and [18, 39]. These positions are all at a distance of 1 or slightly more, and unoccupied. Moving to any of these positions would maximize the agent's welfare. Choosing [17, 40] as it is closest and directly adjacent, maximizing sugar gain while minimizing movement cost."
16,40,movement,[12,39],"The agent is currently at position [13, 38]. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0, found at positions [12, 39], [12, 41], and [13, 42]. All these positions are unoccupied. The closest of these is [12, 39] with a distance of 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [12, 39] to maximize welfare while moving the shortest distance."
16,52,movement,[33,11],"The agent is currently at position [33, 12] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar values up to 4. The highest sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 4, found at positions [33, 11] and [35, 13]. Among these, [33, 11] is closer (distance 1) compared to [35, 13] (distance 2.24). Therefore, the agent should move to [33, 11] to maximize welfare by collecting the highest sugar value at the nearest position."
16,31,movement,[12,41],"The agent is currently at position [9, 39] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 5. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4 at position [12, 41]. This position is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by moving to the position with the maximum sugar value within its vision."
16,59,movement,[18,39],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [18,39], [17,42], and [13,42]. Among these, [18,39] and [17,42] are closest with a distance of 2.24. Choosing [18,39] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
16,15,movement,[35,13],"The agent is currently at position [35,9] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are [35,13] with sugar 4, but it is at distance 4 and unoccupied. Other positions with sugar 3 are closer but occupied or less sugar. Therefore, the agent moves to [35,13] to maximize welfare, as it is unoccupied and has the highest sugar value within vision range."
16,88,movement,[13,42],"The agent is currently at position [13, 39] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions within a distance of 5. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4 at position [13, 42], which is within vision and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake."
16,29,movement,[37,10],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 (position [37,10]). This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision. Therefore, the agent should move to position [37,10]."
16,95,movement,[39,11],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The position [39,11] is unoccupied and at distance 1.0, so it is chosen for movement to maximize welfare and minimize distance."
16,30,movement,[9,36],"Among the visible positions, several have the maximum sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [9,36] and [10,37]. Choosing [9,36] as it is directly north and equally close, moving there maximizes welfare."
16,17,movement,[10,31],"All adjacent positions have equal sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing position [10,31] arbitrarily among the best options."
16,87,movement,[19,34],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [19,34] and [18,35] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at distance 1.0, so either can be chosen. I choose to move to [19,34]."
16,71,movement,[27,32],"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is equal to the current position's sugar value. Since the agent should move to the nearest position with maximum welfare and all have equal sugar, the agent will move to the nearest unoccupied position with sugar 1.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, for example [27,32]."
16,90,movement,[10,39],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3, which is the maximum available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [10,39] and [11,40]. Choosing [10,39] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied, maximizing welfare and minimizing movement distance."

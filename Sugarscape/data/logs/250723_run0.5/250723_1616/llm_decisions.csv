5,8,movement,[34,13],"The agent is currently at position [35, 13] with sugar value 1. The visible positions all have sugar values of 3 or less, with the maximum sugar value being 3. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0: [34, 13] and [35, 14]. Both are unoccupied and equally close. The agent will move to [34, 13] as it is the first found maximum welfare position at minimum distance."
5,35,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 4, so it can only consider positions within a distance of 4 from its current position (31,50). All visible positions with sugar greater than 0 are far away (distance > 40), so none are within vision range. The agent's current position has 0 sugar, and all nearby positions within vision have 0 sugar as well. Therefore, there is no better position to move to within vision range. The agent will not move."
5,24,movement,[19,40],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0 and 1.41, but positions [19,40] and [19,39] are unoccupied and have sugar 3.0. Among these, [19,40] is the closest with distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [19,40] to maximize welfare."
5,82,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position also has zero sugar. Since no position offers better welfare, the agent should not move."
5,71,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is the maximum welfare available. Since the current position [28, 32] is unoccupied and has a sugar value of 1.0, the agent will not move to avoid unnecessary movement."
5,23,movement,[35,4],"The agent is currently at position [35,5] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby positions with higher sugar values (3.0) are available at [35,4], [36,5], [36,4], and [36,6], all unoccupied. These positions are within the agent's vision range and provide maximum welfare compared to other visible positions. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [35,4] at distance 1.0."
5,55,movement,[31,7],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. Several positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [31,7], [33,7], and [32,8]. Choosing any of these will maximize welfare. I select [31,7] as the target position to move to, as it is the first encountered with maximum sugar and minimal distance."
5,14,movement,[13,38],"The agent is currently on a position with sugar value 1.0. There are multiple unoccupied positions within vision that have a higher sugar value of 3.0 at distances 1.0 and 1.41. Among these, the closest position with maximum sugar is at [13,38] with sugar value 3.0 and distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while minimizing movement distance."
5,88,movement,[17,43],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Among these, position [17,43] is unoccupied and closest with sugar 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare."
5,4,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
5,31,movement,[15,38],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with lower values. The agent is currently at position [16, 38] with sugar value 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [15, 38] and [16, 39]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [15, 38] as it is the closest and unoccupied."
5,46,movement,[18,38],"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, so the agent should move to the nearest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0. The closest such positions are at distance 1.0: [18,38] and [19,39]. Choosing [18,38] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
5,59,movement,[15,35],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within vision range. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, the position [15,35] is unoccupied and closest. Therefore, the agent moves to [15,35]."
5,52,movement,[32,11],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [32,11] and [32,12]. Choosing [32,11] as it is the closest and directly adjacent."
5,67,movement,[11,34],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among the positions with sugar 3.0, the closest ones are at distance 1.0: [11,34] and [12,35]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [11,34] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
5,26,movement,[44,12],"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum welfare, which is any adjacent position with sugar value 2.0 at distance 1.0. Choosing position [44,12] as it is the first in the list and equally optimal."
5,17,movement,[10,42],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [10, 42] and [11, 43] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Since both are equally good in terms of welfare and distance, the agent can move to either. Choosing [10, 42] arbitrarily as the target position."
5,20,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
5,30,movement,[12,41],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. The highest sugar value in visible positions is 3.0, available at positions [12, 41], [14, 42], and [13, 43]. Among these, [12, 41] is at distance 1.0, [14, 42] is at distance 1.41 but occupied, and [13, 43] is at distance 2.0. Since [14, 42] is occupied, it is not considered. Therefore, the agent moves to [12, 41], which is the nearest position with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
5,84,movement,[32,12],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0, and all positions with 3.0 sugar are at distances ranging from 1.0 to 5.0. The agent should move to the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value, which is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [32,12] and [33,13]. Either is suitable, but [32,12] is chosen arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar."
5,73,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0 and are unoccupied. The agent is currently on a position with sugar value 1.0. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
5,27,movement,[33,1],"Among the unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [33,1], [35,1], and [34,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [33,1] arbitrarily as the target position."
5,53,movement,[37,6],"The agent is currently at position [37,7] with sugar value 1. All visible unoccupied positions within vision have a sugar value of 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1 or approximately 1.41. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [37,6], which is unoccupied and has sugar value 3."
5,22,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent will stay in place."
5,68,movement,null,"The agent's vision is 3, so it can only consider positions within a distance of 3. All visible positions within this range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Therefore, there is no better position to move to for increased welfare."
5,29,movement,[37,12],"The agent is currently at position [35,12] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with higher sugar values (2 or 3) are available and unoccupied. Among these, positions with sugar value 3 are the maximum welfare positions within vision range. The nearest such positions are at distance 2.0 to 2.24. Choosing the closest one at distance 2.0, position [37,12], which is unoccupied and has sugar value 3, maximizes welfare."
5,44,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 2, so it can only consider positions within distance 2. All visible positions within vision have sugar value 0, including the current position. Therefore, there is no better position to move to within vision. The agent will not move."

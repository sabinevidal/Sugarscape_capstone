29,30,movement,[12,31],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that all have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the sugar at its current position (1.0). Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value (2.0) are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The agent chooses to move to position [12,31], which is unoccupied, has sugar value 2.0, and is at distance 1.0, the nearest maximum welfare position."
29,59,movement,[10,35],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.41: (10,35), (11,37), (8,38), and (10,38). The agent chooses to move to (10,35) as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar and is unoccupied."
29,108,movement,[34,7],"The agent is currently at position [32,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. These positions are [34,7], [34,11], [32,12], [35,8], [35,7], [28,9], [36,8], [35,6], [29,12], [35,12], and [33,14]. The nearest position with sugar 3.0 is [34,7] at distance approximately 2.83. Moving there maximizes welfare while being the closest such position."
29,144,movement,[34,1],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 1.0, which is the maximum welfare available nearby. Among these, positions [34,1], [32,2], [34,2], and [33,3] are unoccupied and at distance 1 or 1.41. The nearest position with maximum welfare is [34,1] at distance 1.0, so the agent should move there."
29,103,movement,[35,12],"The agent is currently at position [36, 12] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [35, 12] and [37, 13]. Both are unoccupied and have the maximum welfare (sugar value) available within vision. The agent will move to the closest one, [35, 12], to maximize welfare and minimize movement distance."
29,50,movement,[16,43],"The agent is currently at position [17, 42] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0, but many of these positions are at a distance greater than 1.41. The closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [16, 43] and [18, 43], both at distance 1.41 and unoccupied. Moving to either of these positions will maximize welfare by increasing sugar intake. Choosing [16, 43] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
29,40,movement,[11,42],"The agent is currently at position [10, 42] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. Several positions have sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0 or slightly more. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are [11, 42] and [10, 43], both at distance 1.0 and unoccupied. The agent will move to [11, 42] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
29,120,movement,[29,12],"The agent is currently at position [30, 13] with sugar value 1.0. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0, but all these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.41 to 4.47. The closest position with sugar 3.0 is [29, 12] at distance 1.41, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [29, 12] to maximize welfare."
29,107,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see three positions within that range: its current position (32,1) with sugar value 1.0, (33,1) with sugar value 1.0, and (32,2) with sugar value 1.0. The position (31,1) is occupied by another agent and thus unavailable. Since all visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value, the agent will stay in its current position to avoid unnecessary movement."
29,113,movement,[30,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [30,1] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there will maximize welfare."
29,119,movement,[41,6],"The agent is currently at position [41,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. All positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and at various distances. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [41,6] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [41,6] to maximize welfare."
29,93,movement,[31,3],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [31,3], [30,4], and [32,4]. All these positions are unoccupied. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar welfare, the agent will move to [31,3]."
29,55,movement,[35,6],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the positions at [35,6], [35,7], and [35,8] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Among these, [35,6] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent moves to [35,6] to maximize its welfare by collecting the highest available sugar at the nearest position."
29,116,movement,[17,37],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. However, the current position has only 1.0 sugar value, so moving to any visible position with 3.0 sugar value would increase welfare. Among the visible positions with 3.0 sugar, the closest is at position [17,37] or [19,41] with a distance of about 3.16. Both are unoccupied. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value within vision, the agent will move to [17,37]."
29,106,movement,[11,40],"The agent is currently at position [12, 40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0 or slightly more. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [11, 40] at distance 1.0. Moving there will maximize the agent's welfare."
29,143,movement,[18,37],"The agent's current position has a sugar value of 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. Several positions have this maximum sugar value, but the closest one is at position [18,37] with a distance of 1.41. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake while minimizing movement distance."
29,2,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [18, 38] with sugar 56.0. All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is significantly lower than the agent's current sugar. Moving to any of these positions would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."
29,132,movement,[34,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 2.0. The positions with sugar 2.0 are [34,3], [33,4], [34,5], [32,4], and [36,4]. However, positions [35,3], [35,4], and [34,6] are occupied, so they are not considered. The closest positions with maximum sugar 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [34,3], [33,4], and [34,5]. Any of these would be equally good. Choosing [34,3] as it is adjacent and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare within vision."
29,87,movement,[14,30],"Among the visible positions within vision range, positions [14, 30] and [13, 31] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is equally good. Choosing to move to [14, 30]."
30,124,movement,[29,7],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 within its vision range. Since all these positions have the same maximum sugar value, the agent will move to the nearest one to maximize welfare. The nearest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0 is at [29,7], which is at distance 1.0 from the current position [29,6]."
30,90,movement,[15,42],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. Among these, position [15,42] is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar. Therefore, the agent should move to [15,42]."
30,55,movement,[35,7],"The agent is currently at position [35,6] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [35,7], [35,8], and [36,8]. The nearest of these is [35,7] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,7] to maximize welfare."

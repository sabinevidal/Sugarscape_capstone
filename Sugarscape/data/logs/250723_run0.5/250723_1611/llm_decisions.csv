4,67,movement,[12,34],"The agent is currently at position [13, 34] with sugar value 1.0. All adjacent positions with higher sugar value (3.0) are unoccupied and within vision. Since all these positions have the same maximum sugar value of 3.0, the agent will move to the nearest one. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [12, 34] and [13, 35]. The agent will move to [12, 34] as it is the first found with maximum welfare and unoccupied."
4,99,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have zero sugar value, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying put conserves energy and avoids unnecessary movement."
4,51,movement,[37,8],"The agent is currently at position [37,9]. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 4.0. The closest positions with sugar value 4.0 are [37,8] and [36,9], both at distance 1. Moving to either would maximize welfare. Choosing [37,8] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
4,29,movement,[35,12],"The agent is currently at position [36,12] with sugar 12. The visible positions within vision are mostly producing sugar values of 3 or 4, but many of these positions are occupied by other agents. The unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value visible are at sugar 4, specifically positions [35,12], [35,11], [36,10], and [35,10]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 4 are at distance 1 or slightly more. The agent will move to the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar, which is [35,12] at distance 1 and sugar 4."
4,6,movement,null,"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is equal to the current position's sugar value. Since moving does not provide any welfare gain and the current position is unoccupied, the agent will stay in place."
4,72,movement,[35,11],"The agent is currently at position [34, 11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 4.0. The closest positions with sugar value 4.0 are [35, 11] at distance 1.0 and [35, 10] at distance 1.41. The agent chooses to move to [35, 11] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) and is unoccupied."
4,63,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. There is no unoccupied position with higher sugar value to move to."
4,60,movement,[36,10],"The agent is currently at position [36, 11] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values of 4 at positions [36, 10], [35, 10], and [36, 9]. These positions have the highest sugar values available within the agent's vision and are unoccupied. Among these, [36, 10] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [36, 10] to maximize welfare."
4,34,movement,[8,31],"All adjacent positions have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent can move to any of these positions. Choosing to move to position [8, 31] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare."
4,81,movement,[28,9],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 (28,9), 1.41 (29,9), and 2.0 (30,8). The nearest is (28,9) at distance 1.0, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent will move to (28,9) to maximize welfare."
4,13,movement,[16,37],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at position [16,37]. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision. Therefore, the agent will move to [16,37] to maximize its welfare."
4,43,movement,[41,8],"The agent is currently at position [42, 8] with a sugar value of 1.0. There are multiple nearby positions within vision range that have a higher sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [41, 8] and [42, 9]. The agent will move to one of these closest positions with maximum sugar value to maximize welfare. Choosing [41, 8] as the target position."
4,64,movement,[30,6],"The agent is currently at position [29,6] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 2, with no occupied positions at those coordinates. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are at distance 1 or slightly more, such as [30,6], [30,5], and [30,7]. Among these, [30,6] is the closest unoccupied position with sugar value 3. Therefore, the agent should move to [30,6] to maximize welfare."
4,82,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent should stay in place."
4,24,movement,[18,40],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0, found at positions [18,40], [18,39], [13,40], and [17,38]. Among these, [18,40] is the closest with a distance of 2.83. Therefore, the agent will move to [18,40]."
4,76,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is the maximum welfare available. The agent is currently at position [22, 27] with sugar value 1.0. Since the current position already provides maximum welfare and is unoccupied, the agent will not move."
4,58,movement,[35,10],"The agent can see several unoccupied positions within its vision range. The positions with the highest sugar value available are at [35,10], [32,10], and [36,9], each with a sugar value of 4. Among these, [35,10] is the closest at a distance of 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,10] to maximize its welfare by collecting the highest sugar nearby."
4,11,movement,[34,3],"The agent is currently at position [34,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have sugar values of 3.0 or 2.0. The maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The agent chooses to move to [34,3], which is at distance 1.0 and has sugar value 3.0, maximizing welfare and minimizing distance."

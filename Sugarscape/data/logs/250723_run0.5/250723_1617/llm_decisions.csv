5,80,movement,[35,14],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0: [35,14] and [36,15]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [35,14] as it is the first found with maximum welfare at minimum distance."
5,15,movement,[32,15],"The agent is currently at position [31, 15] with 7 sugar. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. Several positions have this maximum sugar value and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [31, 14], [30, 15], and [32, 15]. Since [32, 15] is unoccupied and has maximum sugar, the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
5,58,movement,[33,9],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the highest sugar value available is 3.0 at positions [34,8] and [33,9]. Both are at the same sugar value and distance (2.24). The agent chooses to move to [33,9] as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within its vision."
5,38,movement,[38,13],"The agent is currently at position [37, 13] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby positions with the highest sugar value (3.0) are [38, 13], [38, 12], [38, 14], [39, 13], and [37, 15]. All these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest among these is [38, 13] at distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake."
5,12,movement,[33,7],"The agent is currently at position [34,7] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions all have a sugar value of 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0: [33,7] and [34,8]. Both are equally close and have the maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions. The agent will move to [33,7] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare (sugar value)."
5,64,movement,[31,6],"The agent is currently at position [30, 6] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 2, with none higher than 3. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are [31, 6], [30, 7], [31, 5], and [29, 7], all at distance 1 or 1.41. However, positions [31, 6], [30, 7], and [31, 5] are unoccupied and have sugar value 3. The agent will move to the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value, which is [31, 6] at distance 1."
5,69,movement,[21,44],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the position [21,44] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare."
5,87,movement,[20,42],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the positions [20,42], [19,43], and [21,43] all have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Since all are equally near and have the same sugar value, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [20,42] arbitrarily among these options."
5,81,movement,[29,9],"The agent is currently at position [28,9] with sugar 28. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3.0, but some of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41, such as [29,9], [29,8], and [29,10]. Among these, [29,9] is the closest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0. Moving there will maximize the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake."
5,63,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position also has zero sugar. There are no unoccupied positions with higher sugar value to move to."
5,91,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
5,77,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare, there is no benefit in moving."
5,65,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have the same sugar value of 1.0. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare equal to the neighbors, the agent will not move."
5,70,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have zero sugar value, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying in place conserves energy and avoids unnecessary movement."
5,62,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is the maximum welfare available. The agent is currently at position [30,38] which also has sugar value 1.0. Since moving to any other position with the same sugar value does not provide additional welfare and all such positions are at least 1 unit away, the agent will stay in place to conserve energy."
5,40,movement,[19,42],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [19,42] and [18,43]. Both are unoccupied. Moving to either will increase welfare. Choosing [19,42] arbitrarily among the nearest max sugar positions."
5,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
5,98,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar and are either occupied or have no better sugar value than the current position. Therefore, moving does not increase welfare."
5,97,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
5,90,movement,[17,37],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [17, 37]. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare. Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 37]."

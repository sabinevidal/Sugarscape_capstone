20,105,movement,[14,37],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 at various distances. Since all these positions have the same maximum sugar value (3.0) within vision, the agent should move to the nearest one to maximize welfare. The nearest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0 is at [14,37], which is at distance 1.0 from the current position [14,38]."
20,8,movement,[33,9],"The agent is currently at position [34,9] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [33,9], [33,10], [34,11], [32,11], [34,6], [35,6], [31,8], [34,5], [30,9], [34,13], all with sugar value 3. Among these, the closest positions are [33,9] and [33,10] at distances 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [33,9]."
20,11,movement,[33,3],"Among the visible positions, several have the maximum sugar value of 3.0. These positions are [33,3], [34,4], [33,4], [35,4], and [34,5]. All these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [33,3] and [34,4]. Choosing [33,3] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
20,75,movement,[30,3],"The agent can see two positions: its current position (30,2) with sugar value 1.0 and an adjacent position (30,3) with sugar value 2.0. The position (30,3) is unoccupied and has a higher sugar value than the current position, so moving there maximizes welfare."
20,17,movement,[11,30],"Among the visible positions within vision range, positions [11, 30] and [10, 31] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since both are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, moving to [11, 30] is chosen arbitrarily as it is to the right of the current position."
20,30,movement,[11,34],"Among the visible positions, all unoccupied positions have the same maximum sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [11,34], [12,35], and [11,36]. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these is equally beneficial. Choosing [11,34] arbitrarily as the target position."
20,84,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [35,8] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, but all these positions are occupied. Therefore, the agent cannot move to a position with higher welfare. Staying in place is the best option."
20,66,movement,[38,5],"The agent is currently at position [38,6] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 and closest distance are [38,5] (distance 1.0) and [37,5] (distance 1.41). Among these, [38,5] is the nearest unoccupied position with maximum welfare (sugar value 3.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [38,5]."
20,90,movement,[15,41],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Among these positions, the closest one with sugar 3.0 is at position [15,41], which is 2 units away. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing its sugar intake while staying within vision and avoiding occupied positions."
20,116,movement,[11,40],"The agent is currently at position [13,40] with a sugar value of 4.0. All adjacent positions with higher sugar values are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values of 3.0 or less. Since the agent must move to the nearest position with maximum welfare and the maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0, the agent will move to the closest such position, which is [11,40] at distance 2.0 with sugar value 3.0."
20,119,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [37,6] with a sugar value of 3.0. All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, and many positions with sugar 3.0 are occupied. The agent cannot move to any unoccupied position with higher sugar value than its current position. Therefore, the agent will not move."
20,38,movement,[35,4],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with lower values. The agent will move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. Among these, positions at distance 1.0 are preferred over those at distance 1.41 or 2.0. The positions [35,4], [34,5], and [35,6] are all at distance 1.0 and have sugar value 3.0. Choosing [35,4] as it is directly above the current position and unoccupied."
20,40,movement,[13,40],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at position [13, 40]. This position is within the agent's vision and is unoccupied, so the agent will move there to maximize its welfare."
20,26,movement,[39,4],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [39,4], [40,6], and [37,5] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest among these is [39,4] at a distance of 1.0, which maximizes welfare by providing the highest sugar value at the shortest distance. Therefore, the agent should move to [39,4]."
20,2,movement,[13,37],"The agent is currently at position [13, 38] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple unoccupied positions all with sugar value 3, which is the maximum welfare available in its visible range. Among these positions, the closest ones are at distance 1: [13, 37] and [12, 38]. The agent chooses to move to [13, 37] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value and is unoccupied."
20,50,movement,[12,43],"The agent is currently at position [13, 43] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. All positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and at distances ranging from 1.0 to 5.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [12, 43] and [13, 44]. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [12, 43]."
20,53,movement,[36,6],"The agent is currently at position [37,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible unoccupied positions, all have sugar value 3.0 except some with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distances approximately 1.41 to 3.61. The closest such positions are [36,6] and [38,8] at distance 1.41. Choosing [36,6] as it is unoccupied and nearest with maximum sugar value 3.0."

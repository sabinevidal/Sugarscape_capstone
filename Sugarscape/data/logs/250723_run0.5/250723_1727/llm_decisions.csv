26,138,movement,[16,35],"The agent is currently at position [17, 35] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0, but all positions with sugar 3.0 are occupied or out of reach. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [16, 35] and [16, 36], both at distance 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The agent chooses to move to [16, 35] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (sugar 3.0) and is unoccupied."
26,116,movement,[16,39],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [16,39] and [17,40]. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar, the agent will move to [16,39]."
26,15,movement,[39,11],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except a few with 2.0 or 1.0. The agent is currently at position [39,12] with sugar value 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. Among these, positions [39,11] and [39,13] are at distance 1.0 and unoccupied. The agent will move to [39,11] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (sugar value 3.0)."
26,74,movement,[27,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [28,1], [27,2], and [28,3] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [27,2] as the target position arbitrarily among the best options."
26,38,movement,[35,2],"All adjacent positions with higher sugar values are occupied. The only unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values of 2.0 at positions [35,2] and [33,4]. Both have the same sugar value and distance, so moving to [35,2] is chosen arbitrarily to maximize welfare."
26,17,movement,[11,30],"Among the visible positions within vision range, positions [11, 30] and [10, 31] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to [11, 30] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare."
26,124,movement,[29,6],"The agent is currently at position [31,5] with sugar value 1.0. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see several unoccupied positions with sugar values up to 3.0. Among these, the nearest positions with the maximum sugar value of 3.0 are at [29,6], [28,8], [35,7], and [36,6]. The closest of these is [29,6] at a distance of approximately 2.24. Therefore, the agent should move to [29,6] to maximize its welfare."
26,112,movement,[16,42],"The agent is currently at position [16, 41] with sugar value 1.0. All visible positions have sugar value 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The closest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are [16, 42], [17, 40], and [15, 42]. Since all these positions are unoccupied and have the same sugar value, the agent will move to the nearest one, which is [16, 42] at distance 1.0."
26,105,movement,[18,37],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The maximum sugar value available in these positions is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 2.0 (positions [18,37], [16,36], [20,36]). The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [18,37]."
26,60,movement,[35,8],"The agent is currently at position [32,8] with sugar value 1.0. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances ranging from 3.0 to 6.0. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are [35,8] and [35,7], both at distance 3.0 and 3.16 respectively. Both positions are unoccupied. Moving to [35,8] is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value within vision)."
26,81,movement,[29,12],"The agent is currently at position [29, 11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances ranging from 1.0 to 5.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [29, 12], [28, 12], and [30, 12], all at distance approximately 1.0 to 1.41. Choosing the closest one, [29, 12], which is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value within vision, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
26,75,movement,[28,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [28,3], [30,3], and [29,4] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions would maximize welfare. Choosing [28,3] arbitrarily as the target position."
26,126,movement,[11,37],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1 or slightly more. Since the rule is to move to the nearest position producing maximum welfare, the agent should move to one of these positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1. The closest such positions are [11,37], [10,38], and [12,38]. Any of these is equally good in terms of sugar and distance. Choosing [11,37] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
26,53,movement,[38,9],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.41: [40,7], [38,9], and [40,9]. These positions are unoccupied and within vision range. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar welfare, the agent will move to [38,9]."
26,133,movement,[10,38],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The maximum sugar value available in these positions is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.41 and 2.0. The agent chooses to move to position [10,38], which has sugar value 3.0 and is at distance 1.41, the nearest maximum welfare position available."
26,102,movement,[11,42],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [11,42] and [13,42]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [11,42] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
26,140,movement,[9,39],"The agent is currently at position [9, 38] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0 at positions [9, 39], [8, 39], and [10, 39], all at a distance of 1.0 to 1.41. Among these, [9, 39] is the closest and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare by moving to the nearest position with the highest sugar value available."

37,156,movement,[40,8],"The agent is currently at position [40,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Several positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision, such as [40,8], [40,10], [39,8], [39,10], and [41,10]. All these positions have the same sugar value, so the agent should move to the nearest one. The closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [40,8] and [40,10]. The agent can choose either; here, it moves to [40,8]."
37,159,movement,[27,1],"The agent can see three positions within its vision range: its current position (27,2) with sugar value 1.0, and two adjacent positions (27,1) and (26,2) both with sugar value 1.0. Both adjacent positions are unoccupied and have the same sugar value as the current position. Since the agent should move to the nearest position producing maximum welfare and both adjacent positions have equal sugar value, the agent can move to either (27,1) or (26,2). Choosing (27,1) arbitrarily as it is within vision and unoccupied."
37,42,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 1.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. The current position also has a sugar value of 1.0. Since moving does not provide any increase in sugar, and moving costs metabolism, the agent should stay in place."
37,116,movement,[18,42],"The agent is currently at position [17, 41] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. Multiple positions have sugar value 3.0, but the closest one is at distance 1.41 at position [18, 42]. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while being the nearest such position."
37,149,movement,[11,42],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [11,42] and [13,42]. Both are unoccupied and equally close. Choosing [11,42] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
37,139,movement,[31,4],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [31,4] and [30,7] have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are unoccupied and at distances 1.41 and 2.0 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [31,4]. Therefore, the agent should move to [31,4] to maximize welfare."
37,80,movement,[29,9],"The agent is currently at position [28,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 to 3.61. The closest such position is [29,9] at distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare and is the nearest position with maximum sugar value available."
37,143,movement,[13,33],"The agent is currently at position [14,33] with sugar value 1.0. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0, but all these positions are at a distance of at least 1 and are unoccupied. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [13,33] at distance 1.0 and [14,35] at distance 2.0. Since [13,33] is the nearest position with maximum welfare (sugar 3.0) and is unoccupied, the agent should move there to maximize sugar intake."
37,163,movement,[16,34],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The agent chooses the nearest position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The agent selects position [16,34] which is at distance 1.0 and has sugar 3.0, and is unoccupied."
37,128,movement,[30,7],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 3.0 at position [30,7], which is unoccupied and within vision. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other positions with sugar values of 2.0 or 1.0."
37,11,movement,[31,1],"The agent is currently at position [32,1] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby positions within vision have sugar value 2.0 but positions [30,1] and [33,1] are occupied. The closest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 2.0 are [31,1] and [32,2], both at distance 1.0. The agent can move to either, but chooses [31,1] as it is the first found with maximum welfare and unoccupied."
37,7,movement,[13,29],"Among the visible positions, [13,29] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied, making it the best move to maximize welfare. The other positions have lower sugar values or are currently occupied."
37,23,movement,[32,5],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is at [32,5] with sugar 2.0 and distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [32,5] to maximize welfare."
37,59,movement,[9,36],"The agent is currently at position [10, 36] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 2, with no occupied positions at those coordinates. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are at [9, 36], [11, 36], [10, 37], and [11, 37]. Among these, [9, 36], [11, 36], and [10, 37] are at distance 1, and [11, 37] is at distance 1.41. Choosing any of the closest positions with sugar value 3 is optimal. I select [9, 36] as it is unoccupied and at minimum distance with maximum sugar value."
37,93,movement,[29,10],"The agent is currently at position [30,8] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 4, and it can see several unoccupied positions with sugar values mostly 2 or 3. The highest sugar value among unoccupied positions within vision is 3, found at positions [29,10], [31,10], [30,11], [29,11], [31,11], and [30,12]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3 are [29,10] and [31,10] at distance 2.24. The agent will move to one of these closest positions with maximum sugar value to maximize welfare. Choosing [29,10] as the target position."
37,93,reproduction,[80],"Agent 93 is male, age 38, with sugar 64, which is above the minimum sugar required for reproduction (18). There is one eligible partner, agent 80, who is female, age 38, with sugar 47, and has an empty nearby position [28,9]. Agent 93 also has empty nearby positions [28,10] and [29,11]. Both agents meet the fertility and vision criteria, and at least one of them has an empty adjacent site. Therefore, reproduction is possible and beneficial. Since max_partners is 2 but only one eligible partner is available, agent 80 is selected for reproduction."
37,158,movement,[29,14],"The agent is currently at position [29, 13] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. These positions are [30, 13], [29, 14], [30, 12], [29, 11], [30, 11], [31, 11], [32, 12], [31, 10], [32, 11], [33, 13], [32, 16], [33, 11], [34, 13], [34, 12], and [35, 13]. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [30, 13] and [29, 14]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar, the agent will move to [29, 14]."
37,134,movement,[37,8],"The agent is currently at position [35,7] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values are [37,8], [34,9], and [37,9] each with sugar value 3. These positions are unoccupied and within the agent's vision range. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are at distance 2.24. The agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing position [37,8] as it is one of the closest and has maximum sugar value among visible unoccupied positions."
37,88,movement,[16,36],"The agent is currently at position [16, 37] with a sugar value of 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances 1.0 and 2.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [16, 36] and [16, 38], both at distance 1.0. The agent will move to one of these positions to maximize welfare and minimize movement distance. Choosing [16, 36] arbitrarily as it is equally beneficial as [16, 38]."
37,115,movement,[32,16],"The agent is currently at position [31,16] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 2 or 3, but many of the positions with sugar value 3 are occupied or out of reach. The nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value is [32,16] with sugar value 3 and distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [32,16] to maximize welfare."

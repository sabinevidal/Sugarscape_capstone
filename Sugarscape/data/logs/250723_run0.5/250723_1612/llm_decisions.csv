4,93,movement,[26,5],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value (2.0) are at distance 1.0: [26,5] and [25,6]. Choosing [26,5] as it is the first found with maximum welfare at minimum distance."
4,2,movement,[13,40],"The agent is currently at position [14, 41] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 4, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value is [13, 40] with sugar value 4 and distance approximately 1.41. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while being close by."
4,38,movement,[37,13],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision range. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0. Among these, moving to any of [37,13], [36,14], or [38,14] would be optimal. Choosing [37,13] as it is directly north and equally optimal."
4,14,movement,[13,39],"The agent can see several unoccupied positions within its vision range. The position [13,39] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 among unoccupied positions. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by collecting more sugar."
4,59,movement,[15,34],"The agent is currently at position [16,34] with sugar 15. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4 at [17,38], but it is at a distance of 4.12. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3 at closer distances (1.0 to 3.16). The agent should move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value available, which is 3. Among these, the closest positions are [15,34] and [16,35] at distance 1.0, both unoccupied. Choosing [15,34] as the move target."
4,80,movement,[36,14],"The agent is currently at position [36, 13] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar value 3 at distances ranging from 1 to 3.16. All these positions are unoccupied. Since the agent must move to the nearest position with maximum welfare (maximum sugar value), it will choose one of the positions with sugar value 3 that is closest. The closest positions with sugar 3 are [36, 14] at distance 1.0 and [35, 14] at distance 1.41. Among these, [36, 14] is the closest. Therefore, the agent will move to [36, 14]."
4,90,movement,[17,38],"The agent is currently at position [19, 36] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are [17, 38] and [18, 39], both with sugar value 4. Among these, [17, 38] is closer (distance 2.83) compared to [18, 39] (distance 3.16). Both positions are unoccupied. Therefore, the agent will move to [17, 38] to maximize welfare."
4,96,movement,[11,40],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the vision range. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0: [11,40], [10,41], and [11,42]. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to [11,40] is chosen arbitrarily as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
4,69,movement,[23,44],"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, any position is equally good, so the agent moves to [23,44]."
4,66,movement,[35,7],"The agent is currently at position [36,7] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values are [35,7] and [36,9], both with sugar value 4. Among these, [35,7] is closer (distance 1) compared to [36,9] (distance 2). The position [35,7] is not occupied and offers the maximum welfare within the agent's vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,7]."
4,18,movement,[41,14],"The agent is currently at position [43,16] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0, but all these positions are at distances greater than 2.8 and none are occupied. The closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances around 2.83 to 4.0. Among these, the position [41,14] is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value of 3.0 within the agent's vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [41,14] to maximize welfare."
4,5,movement,[11,39],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. However, the current position is occupied by the agent itself, so it can move to a position with sugar value 3.0 which is unoccupied and nearest. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.41 (11,39) and 2.0 (12,38, 10,40). The closest is (11,39) with sugar 3.0, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
4,46,movement,[18,39],"The agent is currently at position [15, 40] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at [18, 39] with sugar 4, which is unoccupied and within vision range. This position provides the maximum welfare and is the nearest among the highest sugar positions. Therefore, the agent should move to [18, 39]."
4,65,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0. Since the current position is unoccupied and has the maximum welfare (sugar value 1.0), there is no benefit in moving."
4,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
4,3,movement,[33,6],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [33,6] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare as per the movement rule."
4,75,movement,[40,1],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [40,1], [42,1], and [41,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [40,1] arbitrarily among these options."
4,37,movement,[36,9],"The agent is currently at position [35,9] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are [36,9] and [32,10] and [33,12], each with sugar value 4. Among these, [36,9] is the closest (distance 1.0) and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,9] to maximize welfare."
4,27,movement,[34,1],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the positions [34,1], [36,1], and [35,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally near and have the same sugar value, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [34,1] arbitrarily as the target."
4,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. There is no better position to move to for increasing welfare."
4,31,movement,[16,38],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.41 (positions [16,38]) and 2.0 (positions [15,37], [17,39]). The closest position with maximum sugar is [16,38], which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [16,38]."
4,17,movement,[11,42],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [11, 42] and [13, 42] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Since both are equally good in terms of welfare and distance, moving to either is beneficial. Choosing to move to [11, 42]."
4,45,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value and are unoccupied, so moving does not increase welfare. The agent should stay in its current position."
4,20,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Moving to any other position does not increase welfare."
4,30,movement,[13,41],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see several unoccupied positions with sugar values. The maximum sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 2.0, found at positions [13,41], [14,38], [16,40], and [14,42]. Among these, the nearest position is [13,41] with a distance of approximately 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [13,41] to maximize welfare."

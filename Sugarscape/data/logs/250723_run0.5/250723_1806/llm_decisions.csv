35,74,movement,[29,1],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [29,1], [28,2], and [30,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. All are at equal distance (1 unit) from the agent's current position. Choosing to move to [29,1] as it is directly north and equally beneficial."
35,5,movement,[15,40],"The agent is currently at position [19, 39] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [15, 40] and [15, 37]. Both are at distances 4.12 and 4.47 respectively. The agent chooses to move to [15, 40] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value available."
35,141,movement,[33,12],"The agent is currently at position [31,11] with sugar 26.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [33,12] has the highest sugar value of 4.0. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by moving to the position with the highest sugar available nearby."
35,139,movement,[31,5],"The agent can see several unoccupied positions within its vision range. The positions with the highest sugar value available are at coordinates [31,5] and [30,6], both with sugar value 3.0. Among these, [31,5] is closer (distance 1.41) compared to [30,6] (distance 2.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [31,5] to maximize welfare."
35,23,movement,[32,5],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the position [32,5] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is within vision range at distance 1. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other available positions with lower sugar values."
35,88,movement,[15,37],"The agent is currently at position [13, 34] with sugar 8.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at position [15, 37], which is within the agent's vision range. Moving there would maximize the agent's welfare by increasing its sugar intake. The position is unoccupied and reachable within vision."
35,113,movement,[28,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [28,3], [30,3], and [29,4] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar and equal distance, moving to any of these positions would maximize welfare. Choosing to move to [28,3] arbitrarily among the best options."
35,107,movement,[30,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [30, 2], [32, 2], and [31, 3] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions would maximize welfare. Choosing [30, 2] arbitrarily as the target position."
35,111,movement,[35,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [35,3] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other positions with sugar value 2.0 or the current position with sugar value 1.0."
35,2,movement,[17,37],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, such as [17,37]. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision range."
35,56,movement,[32,13],"The agent is currently at position [32, 12] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [32, 13] at distance 1.0 and [32, 10] at distance 2.0, among others. The closest and highest welfare position is [32, 13]. Therefore, the agent should move to [32, 13]."
35,131,movement,[14,34],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.41 and 2.0. The closest position with maximum sugar is at [14, 34] with distance 1.41. This position is unoccupied and within vision range, so moving there maximizes welfare."
35,57,movement,[20,39],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The agent will move to the nearest such position to maximize welfare. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [20,39], [21,40], and [20,41]. The agent is currently at [20,40]. Moving to any of these positions yields the same welfare, so the agent will move to [20,39] as it is the first in the list of closest positions."
35,103,movement,[36,14],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: (36,14), (38,14), and (37,15). Choosing (36,14) as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
35,55,movement,[38,7],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.41, such as (38,7), (36,9), and (38,9). Choosing the closest among these, (38,7) is unoccupied and at distance 1.41, so the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
35,148,movement,[14,42],"The agent is currently at position [16, 38] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at position [14, 42]. This position is within the agent's vision range (distance 4.47) and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake."
35,114,movement,[35,4],"The agent is currently at position [35,5] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0 at positions [35,4], [34,6], [36,6], [37,6], [34,7], and [34,8]. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [35,4] at distance 1.0 and [34,6] and [36,6] at distance 1.41. The agent chooses to move to [35,4] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value and is unoccupied."
35,105,movement,[17,34],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [17,34] and [19,34]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [17,34] as it is to the left and closer to the cluster of neighbors, potentially beneficial for social or reproductive reasons."
35,127,movement,[35,12],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 2.0. The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [35,12] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,12] to maximize welfare."
35,116,movement,[20,41],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [20,41] and [19,42]. Both are unoccupied. Moving to either will increase welfare. Choosing [20,41] arbitrarily among the closest max sugar positions."
35,123,movement,null,"The agent can only see positions within a vision of 1. The current position [30,1] has a sugar value of 1.0, and all adjacent positions within vision are occupied by other agents. No unoccupied positions with higher sugar value are available within vision. Therefore, the agent should not move."
35,155,movement,[32,7],"The agent is currently at position [32,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have sugar value 3.0, which is higher than the current position. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [32,7], [31,8], and [33,8]. Moving to any of these positions will increase the agent's welfare. Choosing [32,7] as it is directly north and equally close as the others."
35,102,movement,[16,44],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except a few with 2.0 or less, and all positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1 or more. The agent is currently at position [15,44] with sugar 37.5. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1, such as [16,44], [15,45], [14,43], [16,43], [14,45], and [16,45]. Among these, all are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar, which is any of these at distance 1. Choosing [16,44] as the target position."

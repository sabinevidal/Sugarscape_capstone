22,66,movement,[37,7],"The agent is currently at position [38,7] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [38,6] and [37,7], both with sugar value 3 and at distance 1. Since both have the same sugar value and distance, the agent can move to either. Choosing [37,7] as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision range."
22,8,movement,[34,8],"The agent is currently at position [33,8] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [34,8], [31,7], and [31,9], each with sugar value 3. Among these, [34,8] is the closest at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,8] to maximize welfare."
22,122,movement,[18,40],"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [18,40], [19,41], and [18,42]. All these positions are unoccupied. Choosing the closest one, [18,40], to maximize welfare and minimize movement cost."
22,80,movement,[31,9],"The agent is currently at position [31,10] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available at unoccupied positions is 3.0. Several positions with sugar value 3.0 are available and unoccupied, such as [31,9], [31,11], [30,11], and others. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [31,9] and [31,11]. Moving to either of these positions will maximize welfare. Choosing [31,9] as the target position as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
22,7,movement,[17,30],"All visible positions at distance 1 have the same maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent can move to any of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing position [17, 30] arbitrarily among them."
22,74,movement,[27,2],"The agent can move to position [27, 2] which is unoccupied and has the highest sugar value (2.0) within its vision range. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare."
22,72,movement,[31,11],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. However, the current position is occupied by the agent itself, so moving to any unoccupied position with sugar value 3.0 is beneficial. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, such as [31,11]. Therefore, the agent should move to [31,11]."
22,124,movement,[31,7],"The agent is currently at position [34,5] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values mostly 2 or 3. The highest sugar value among unoccupied positions within vision is 3, found at positions [31,7], [36,8], and [38,6]. Among these, [31,7] and [36,8] are at distance 3.61, and [38,6] is at distance 4.12. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [31,7]."
22,57,movement,[9,39],"The agent is currently at position [10, 39] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3.0 or 2.0, but many are occupied. The nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value is [9, 39] with sugar value 3.0, which is at distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare within the agent's vision and is unoccupied."
22,125,movement,[13,38],"The agent is currently at position [12, 37] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0, but all positions with sugar 3.0 are at distances greater than 1.41 and are unoccupied. The closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [13, 38] at distance 1.41 and [13, 39] at distance 2.24. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [13, 38]."
22,113,movement,[30,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, positions [30,1] and [30,3] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is equally good. Choosing to move to [30,1]."
22,121,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is significantly lower than the sugar values of occupied neighboring positions. Since all positions with higher sugar values are occupied, the agent cannot move to a better position. Therefore, the agent should stay in its current position."
22,23,movement,[36,2],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have the same sugar value of 2.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0 (positions [36,2] and [37,3]). Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [36,2]."
22,115,movement,[29,9],"The agent is currently at position [30,9] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [29,9] and [29,10], both at distance 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The agent chooses to move to [29,9] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value available and unoccupied."
22,46,movement,[18,37],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 around it. All these positions are unoccupied and at a distance of 1 to 3 units. Since the maximum sugar value visible is 3.0 and multiple positions have this value, the agent should move to the nearest one to maximize welfare. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [18,37] and [19,38]. Choosing [18,37] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
22,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
22,110,movement,[33,13],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [33,13] and [34,14]. Choosing the closest position with maximum welfare, I select [33,13]."
22,96,movement,[9,36],"The agent is currently at position [10, 36] with sugar 16.0. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but many of these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [9, 36], [9, 37], and [9, 38]. Among these, [9, 36] is the nearest (distance 1.0). Moving there maximizes welfare by moving to the highest sugar value position available within vision and unoccupied."
22,27,movement,[28,3],"The agent can only see positions within vision 1. The current position has sugar value 1.0. The only unoccupied visible position is [28,3] with sugar value 2.0, which is higher than the current position. Therefore, the agent should move to [28,3] to maximize welfare."
22,53,movement,[38,6],"The agent is currently at position [36,4] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 2 or 3, but many of the higher sugar value positions (3) are at distances 2.83, 4.0, and 6.0. The closest positions with sugar value 2 are at distance 1.0 to 2.24, but these positions are mostly occupied. The unoccupied position with the highest sugar value and nearest distance is [38,6] with sugar value 3 and distance 2.83, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [38,6] to maximize welfare."
22,29,movement,[40,10],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [40,10] and [41,11]. Choosing to move to [40,10] as it is directly adjacent and provides maximum sugar value."
22,128,movement,[33,9],"The agent is currently at position [32,9] with sugar value 4.0. Nearby positions with higher sugar values are occupied. The unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values of 2.0 or less. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0 (positions [33,9] and [32,10]). Moving to either would increase sugar intake compared to the current position. Choosing [33,9] as it is the closest with maximum welfare among unoccupied positions."

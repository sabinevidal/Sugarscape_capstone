25,46,movement,[17,37],"The agent is currently at position [17, 38] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. Multiple positions have sugar value 3.0, but the closest one is at [17, 37] with distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 37] to maximize welfare."
25,142,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [31,9] with sugar value 3.0. All visible positions have sugar value 3.0 except some with lower values. However, all positions with sugar value 3.0 within vision range are either occupied or the current position. Therefore, the agent cannot move to a position with higher welfare and should stay in place."
25,60,movement,[32,8],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the positions [32,8] and [34,8] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are at the same distance (3.16) from the agent's current position (33,5). The agent chooses to move to [32,8] as it is the first among the highest welfare positions found."
25,12,movement,[34,8],"The agent is currently at position [34,5] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [34,8], [38,7], [36,9], [39,5], and [39,6]. The closest of these is [34,8] at distance 3.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,8] to maximize welfare."
25,26,movement,[39,5],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [39,5] and [40,6], both at distance 1.0 and unoccupied. Choosing [39,5] as the target position for movement."
25,108,movement,[33,12],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [33,12] and [35,13]. Choosing [33,12] as it is the first found closest position with maximum sugar and unoccupied."
25,75,movement,[29,3],"The agent can see two positions: its current position (29,2) with sugar value 1.0 and an adjacent position (29,3) with sugar value 2.0. The adjacent position (29,3) is unoccupied and has a higher sugar value than the current position. Therefore, moving to (29,3) maximizes welfare."
25,119,movement,[38,7],"The agent is currently at position [35,6] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0 at positions [38,7], [36,9], [39,6], [39,7], [39,8], [40,6], and [40,7]. Among these, the closest unoccupied position is [38,7] at a distance of approximately 3.16. Since this position is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value visible, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
25,139,movement,[31,3],"The agent can move to position [31,3] which is unoccupied and has the highest sugar value (2.0) within its vision range. Other positions have lower sugar values or are occupied."
25,72,movement,[36,9],"The agent is currently at position [36,11] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value of 3 is at [36,9], which is 2 units away. Moving there will maximize the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake."
25,23,movement,[37,3],"The agent has a vision of 2 and sees multiple positions with sugar value 2.0 within its vision range. All these positions are unoccupied except for position [38,4], which is occupied. The agent is currently at position [37,4] with sugar value 1.0. Moving to any of the positions with sugar value 2.0 will increase its welfare. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [37,3]. Therefore, the agent will move to position [37,3]."
25,53,movement,[39,8],"The agent is currently at position [38,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0 at multiple positions such as [39,8], [39,7], [39,6], [40,7], [40,6], [40,10], [41,8], [41,9], [39,11], [41,10], [42,8], [42,9], [41,11], [42,10], and [39,13]. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [39,8] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [39,8] to maximize welfare."
26,106,movement,[15,39],"The agent is currently at position [15, 38] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [15, 39], [13, 38], [18, 40], and [16, 43]. The nearest of these is [15, 39] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 39] to maximize welfare."
26,56,movement,[35,13],"The agent is currently at position [37,10]. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [35,13] and [33,11]. Both are at distances greater than 3.6. The agent's vision is 5, so these positions are reachable. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [35,13] at distance 3.61, which is closer than [33,11]. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,13] to maximize welfare."
26,132,movement,[35,3],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. The highest sugar value available within vision is 3.0 at position [35,3], which is unoccupied and at distance 2.0. Other positions have sugar value 2.0 but are closer or at the same distance. Therefore, the agent moves to [35,3]."
26,136,movement,[34,1],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [34,1] and [35,2]. Choosing to move to [34,1] as it is directly adjacent and equally beneficial."
26,119,movement,[39,7],"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [39,7]. This position is unoccupied and within vision range. Therefore, the agent should move to [39,7] to maximize welfare."
26,109,movement,[40,10],"The agent is currently at position [40, 11] with sugar value 1.0. All visible positions have sugar values of 3.0 or 2.0, which are higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [40, 10], [39, 11], and [41, 11]. All these positions are unoccupied. The agent will move to one of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [40, 10] as it is directly adjacent and has maximum sugar value."

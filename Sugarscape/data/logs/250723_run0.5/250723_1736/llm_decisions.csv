28,71,movement,[18,34],"The agent has a vision of 4 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances 1.0 to 2.83. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [18,34] and [19,35]. Both are unoccupied. The agent will choose to move to [18,34] as it is the first closest position with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
28,52,movement,[32,8],"The agent is currently at position [31,7] with sugar value 1.0. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see several unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances ranging from 1.41 to 6.0. Since the movement rule is to move to the nearest position producing maximum welfare, the agent should move to the closest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value. The highest sugar value visible is 3.0, and the nearest positions with this value are [32,8] at distance 1.41 and [33,7] at distance 2.0. Among these, [32,8] is the closest. Therefore, the agent should move to [32,8]."
28,109,movement,[41,9],"The agent is currently at position [41, 10] with sugar value 1.0. All neighboring positions with higher sugar value (3.0) are unoccupied and within vision range. Since all these positions have the same maximum sugar value of 3.0, the agent will move to the nearest one. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [41, 9], [42, 10], and [41, 11]. The agent will choose to move to [41, 9] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
28,37,movement,[37,7],"The agent is currently at position [36,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0, available at multiple positions such as [37,7], [35,6], [37,8], [38,7], [36,9], [38,6], [34,8], [34,9], [33,7], [33,8], [39,8], [37,10], [39,5], [39,9], [40,5], [32,9], [41,7], [41,6], and [41,8]. However, many of these positions are beyond the agent's vision or are occupied. The agent's vision is 6, and it can only move to unoccupied positions. Checking the occupied positions, the positions [37,7], [35,6], and [37,8] are unoccupied and within vision. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar 3.0 are [37,7], [35,6], and [37,8], all at distance 1 or 1.41. The nearest is [37,7] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,7] to maximize welfare."
28,129,movement,[29,14],"The agent is currently at position [29, 13] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3.0 at positions [29, 14], [30, 14], [28, 11], [30, 15], and [31, 15]. Among these, [29, 14] is the closest (distance 1.0) and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [29, 14] to maximize welfare."
28,85,movement,[39,8],"The agent is currently at position [40,8] with sugar value 1.0. All visible positions have sugar values of 3.0 or 2.0, but many of the positions with sugar value 3.0 are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [39,8] and [41,8]. Both are unoccupied and have the highest sugar value available nearby. The agent will move to [39,8] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum welfare and unoccupied."
28,75,movement,[27,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [27,2], [29,2], and [28,3] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions would maximize welfare. Choosing [27,2] arbitrarily as the target position."
28,117,movement,[37,8],"The agent is currently at position [37,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [37,8], [36,9], and [37,10], all at distance 1.0 and unoccupied. Moving to any of these positions will maximize welfare. Choosing [37,8] as the target position as it is the closest and provides maximum sugar value."
28,56,movement,[33,13],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is lower than the sugar values of occupied neighboring positions. Since the agent can only move to unoccupied positions and none of the unoccupied positions have higher sugar than the current position's neighbors, the agent will move to the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. Among these, positions [33,13] and [34,14] are at distance 1.0, so the agent will move to [33,13] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
28,50,movement,[17,42],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [17,42], [18,43], and [17,44]. Choosing the first in the list, [17,42], to move to."
28,17,movement,[11,30],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [11, 30] and [10, 31] have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Both are at distance 1.0. Choosing to move to [11, 30] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare and unoccupied."
28,23,movement,[36,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.41: (36,3) and (38,3). Choosing (36,3) as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare and unoccupied."
28,108,movement,[32,9],"The agent is currently at position [32,11] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distances 2.0 to 3.61. The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 3 is [32,9] at distance 2.0. Moving there maximizes welfare and is the closest such position."
28,116,movement,[16,40],"The agent is currently at position [16, 39] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0. These positions are [16, 40], [15, 38], [17, 37], [14, 38], [18, 38], [18, 41], [19, 39], [20, 39], [15, 35], [17, 35], [20, 38], [20, 40], [13, 36], [19, 36], [19, 42], [18, 35], [12, 37], [12, 41], [20, 41], [18, 43], [11, 39], [21, 39], [16, 44], [11, 38], [21, 38], [11, 40], [21, 40], [15, 44], [17, 44], [10, 39], [22, 39], [16, 45]. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are [16, 40] (distance 1.0) and [15, 38] (distance 1.41). The closest is [16, 40]. Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 40] to maximize welfare and minimize distance."
28,11,movement,[32,2],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [32,2], [31,3], and [33,3]. Any of these positions would maximize welfare. Choosing [32,2] as it is directly adjacent and equally beneficial."
28,119,movement,[41,7],"The agent is currently at position [40,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. All positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and at distances ranging from 1.0 to 6.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [41,7], [41,6], and [41,8] at distances 1.0 and 1.41. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [41,7]."
28,105,movement,[18,35],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. However, the current position is occupied by the agent itself, so it is not considered occupied. The agent should move to the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. The maximum sugar value among visible unoccupied positions is 3.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [18,35] and [19,36]. Both are unoccupied. The agent will move to [18,35] as it is the first found nearest position with maximum sugar value."
28,102,movement,[15,44],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [15,44]. This position is unoccupied and thus chosen for movement to maximize welfare."
28,12,movement,[33,7],"The agent is currently at position [33,6] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [33,7], [35,6], [33,8], [34,8], [34,9], [36,9], [38,6], and [38,7]. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [33,7] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,7] to maximize welfare."

7,3,movement,[34,4],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [34,4], [33,5], and [35,5] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar value and distance, moving to any of these positions would maximize welfare. Choosing [34,4] arbitrarily as the target position."
7,77,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the agent is already on a position with maximum sugar value and no other position offers higher welfare, the agent will not move."
7,32,movement,[24,35],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [24,35], [25,36], [24,34], [24,36], [23,35], and [25,37] all have the maximum sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [24,35] and [25,36]. Choosing [24,35] as it is the first encountered with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
7,58,movement,[32,8],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The maximum sugar value available in these positions is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at [32,8] (distance 1.0), [32,7] (1.41), and [34,7] (1.41). The agent chooses the closest position with maximum sugar, which is [32,8]."
7,7,movement,[10,34],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [10,34], [9,35], and [10,36] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [10,34] arbitrarily as it is directly north and unoccupied."
7,26,movement,[42,11],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [42,11] and [41,12]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [42,11] as it is directly above the current position and equally optimal."
7,17,movement,[10,40],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [10,40] and [9,41] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is equally good. Choosing [10,40] arbitrarily as the target position to maximize welfare."
7,20,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
7,11,movement,[32,4],"The agent can see several unoccupied positions within its vision range. Among these, the positions [32,4] and [33,5] have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are at a distance of 1.0, which is the nearest maximum welfare. Therefore, the agent should move to one of these positions to maximize its sugar intake. Choosing [32,4] as the target position."
7,62,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is the maximum welfare available. The agent is currently at position [30,38] which also has sugar value 1.0. Since the current position is already optimal and unoccupied, the agent will not move."
7,51,movement,[38,6],"The agent is currently at position [38,7] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, but all these positions are unoccupied and at a distance of 1 or more. Since the agent should move to the nearest position producing maximum welfare, it will move to one of the positions with sugar value 3 at distance 1. Among these, [38,6], [37,7], and [39,7] are all at distance 1 and have sugar value 3. Choosing [38,6] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
7,57,movement,[13,41],"The agent is currently at position [14, 42] with sugar value 1.0. All visible positions have sugar values of 3.0 or less, but the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions within vision is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.41, such as [13, 41], [13, 43], and [15, 43]. These positions are unoccupied and provide maximum welfare within the agent's vision. The agent will move to the nearest such position, [13, 41]."
7,10,movement,[39,1],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see many positions within that range. Among the visible positions, the one with the highest sugar value is at coordinates [39,1] with a sugar value of 2.0. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [39,1] to maximize its welfare by collecting more sugar."
7,55,movement,[30,6],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3 or less, with none exceeding 3. The nearest positions with the maximum sugar value of 3 are at distance 1 (positions [30,6] and [30,8]). Both are unoccupied. Choosing to move to [30,6] as it is the first encountered with maximum sugar value and minimum distance."
7,12,movement,[33,6],"The agent is currently at position [32,6] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3, but many of these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 are [33,6], [32,7], and [33,5], all at distance 1 or slightly more. Moving to any of these positions will maximize welfare compared to the current position. Choosing [33,6] as it is unoccupied, has maximum sugar value within vision, and is closest."
7,53,movement,[37,4],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [37,4] and [38,5]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [37,4] as it is directly north and equally beneficial."
7,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value except the current position, which also has zero sugar. Therefore, there is no better position to move to for increasing welfare."
7,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. There is no benefit in moving to any other position as they do not provide higher welfare."
7,52,movement,[30,11],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are not occupied. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available nearby. The agent chooses the nearest such position to maximize welfare and minimize movement cost. The closest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0 is at [30,11], which is at distance 1.0 from the current position [31,11]."
7,70,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent will stay in place."
7,46,movement,[18,36],"The agent is currently at position [18,37] with sugar value 1.0. All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [18,36] and [19,37]. Both are unoccupied. The agent will move to one of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [18,36] as it is directly adjacent and within vision."
8,69,movement,[20,42],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with lower values. Since all positions with maximum sugar value (3.0) are unoccupied, the agent will move to the nearest position with sugar value 3.0, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, the agent can choose any position at distance 1.0 with sugar 3.0. Choosing position [20,42] as it is directly north and unoccupied."

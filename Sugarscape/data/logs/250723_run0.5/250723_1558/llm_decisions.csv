1,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. There is no benefit in moving to any other position as they do not provide higher welfare."
1,29,movement,[40,14],"The agent is currently at position [41,14] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions all have a sugar value of 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1 or approximately 1.41. The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [40,14] at distance 1. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision range."
1,49,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have a sugar value of 0.0, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying put conserves energy and avoids unnecessary movement."
1,86,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have zero sugar value, so there is no benefit in moving."
1,10,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [39, 45] with 13 sugar. All visible positions within vision range have 0 sugar except one position at [39, 1] which has 2 sugar but is too far (distance 44) and outside the agent's vision range of 6. The immediate neighboring positions with sugar are occupied. Therefore, there is no better unoccupied position with sugar within vision to move to."
1,6,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 1.0 except the current position which also has 1.0 sugar. Since the current position is occupied by the agent itself and has the maximum sugar value available, and moving to any other position would not increase welfare, the agent should not move."
1,60,movement,[38,11],"The agent is currently at position [41, 13] with sugar 25. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4.0, but all these positions are at distances greater than 3.6 and are unoccupied. The agent's vision is 6, so it can see these positions. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 4.0 are at distances around 3.61 to 4.47. The agent should move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [38, 11] at distance 3.61 and sugar 4.0. This position is unoccupied and within vision range, so moving there maximizes welfare."
1,39,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
1,16,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position also has zero sugar. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will not move."
1,64,movement,[24,7],"The agent is currently at position [20,7] with sugar value 1.0. All nearby positions with higher sugar values (20, 18, 19, 21, 8) are occupied. The unoccupied visible positions have sugar values of 2.0 or 1.0, with the maximum unoccupied sugar value being 2.0 at positions [24,7], [24,8], [25,7], [25,8], and [26,7]. Among these, the closest is [24,7] at distance 4.0, which is within the agent's vision of 6. Therefore, the agent should move to [24,7] to maximize welfare."
1,38,movement,[38,15],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Since all positions with maximum sugar value (3.0) are unoccupied and at distance 1 or 1.41, the agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, the agent can choose any of the positions [38,15], [37,16], or [39,16]. Choosing [38,15] arbitrarily as it is directly above the current position."
1,37,movement,[32,9],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [32,9], [33,8], [33,9], and [34,8]. Among these, [32,9] is the closest at a distance of 4.12. This position is unoccupied and within vision, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
1,82,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position also has zero sugar. Since no position offers better welfare, the agent will not move."
1,13,movement,[17,33],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 3.0 at multiple positions (e.g., [17,33], [16,33], [15,33], [17,34], [16,34], [18,34], [17,35]). Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 4.0 to 4.47. Since none of these positions are occupied, the agent will move to the nearest one with sugar 3.0, which is at position [17,33]."
1,5,movement,[6,35],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 3.0, but all positions with sugar 3.0 are at distances greater than 4.0 and are unoccupied. The closest positions with sugar 2.0 are at distance 1.0 and unoccupied, specifically positions [6,35] and [5,36]. Since the agent prioritizes maximum welfare and then nearest position, it chooses one of these positions with sugar 2.0 at distance 1.0. Among these, [6,35] is chosen arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar available nearby."
1,18,movement,[43,18],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 2.0 or 1.0. The highest sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 2.0 at position [43,18]. This position is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to staying at the current position with sugar value 1.0."
1,4,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, so there is no better position to move to for increasing welfare. The current position is unoccupied and has zero sugar, so the agent should stay in place."
1,55,movement,[30,6],"Among the visible positions, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [30,6] and [29,7]. Choosing [30,6] as the target position to move to, as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare at the shortest distance."
1,51,movement,[41,6],"The agent's vision is 6, and within this range, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0. Several positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances around 4.12 to 6.0, such as [41,6], [42,8], and [41,7]. These positions are unoccupied and provide maximum welfare compared to closer positions with sugar value 2.0. The agent will move to the nearest position with sugar value 3.0, which is [41,6] at distance 4.12."
1,22,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
1,74,movement,[41,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, positions [41,1] and [42,2] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are at distance 1.0. Since both are equally good in terms of welfare and distance, the agent can move to either. Choosing [41,1] arbitrarily."
1,42,movement,[25,13],"The agent is currently at position [24, 13] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with higher sugar values (2.0) are [25, 13], [25, 12], [24, 11], and [26, 13]. Among these, [25, 13] is the closest (distance 1.0) and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [25, 13] to maximize welfare."
1,92,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 2 and can only consider positions within that range. All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 0, which is not better than the current position's sugar value of 0. Therefore, moving does not increase welfare."
1,14,movement,[13,39],"All visible positions have the same maximum sugar value of 4.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0. Among these, any can be chosen. I choose to move to position [13,39] which is directly north and at distance 1.0."
1,20,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Moving to any other position does not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."
1,88,movement,[14,43],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [14,43] and [13,42]. Both are at distances 4.12 and 5.0 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [14,43]."

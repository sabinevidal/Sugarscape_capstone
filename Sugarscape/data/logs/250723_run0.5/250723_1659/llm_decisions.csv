20,110,movement,[34,7],"The agent is currently at position [36,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [34,7] and [35,10], both at a distance of approximately 2.24. Moving to either position would increase the agent's welfare. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [34,7]."
20,113,movement,[30,1],"The agent is currently at position [31,1] with a sugar value of 2.0. The visible positions within vision range are [30,1] and [32,1], both with sugar value 2.0 and unoccupied. Since the sugar values are equal, the agent will move to the nearest position with maximum welfare, which can be either [30,1] or [32,1]. Choosing [30,1] arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and at distance 1."
20,80,movement,[32,10],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the positions [32,10] and [35,10] both have the highest sugar value of 4.0. Both are at a similar distance (1.41 and 2.24 respectively), but [32,10] is closer. Therefore, the agent moves to [32,10] to maximize welfare by collecting the highest available sugar at the nearest position."
20,74,movement,[28,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [28,1] and [29,2] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since both are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, moving to [28,1] is chosen arbitrarily as it is to the left of the current position."
20,120,movement,[35,10],"The agent is currently at position [38,8] with a sugar value of 3.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [35,10] has the highest sugar value of 4.0. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision. Therefore, moving to [35,10] maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake."
20,118,movement,[17,40],"The agent is currently at position [14, 42] with a sugar value of 3.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [12, 40], [12, 39], and [17, 40]. However, positions [12, 41] and [12, 40] are occupied, and [12, 39] is also occupied. The position [17, 40] with sugar 4.0 is unoccupied and within vision range. Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 40] to maximize welfare."
20,46,movement,[18,39],"The agent is currently at position [18, 40] with sugar 19.5. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [18, 39] and [12, 40]. Both positions are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar) is [18, 39] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [18, 39]."
20,87,movement,[15,34],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [15, 34] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare as per the movement rule."
20,107,movement,[31,1],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [31,1], [32,2], and [31,3] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar value and distance, moving to any of these positions would maximize welfare. Choosing [31,1] arbitrarily as the target position."
20,114,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [35,7] with sugar value 4.0. All adjacent positions with higher sugar values (like [35,5] with 48.5, [38,6] with 43.0, and [34,8] with 58.0) are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions have sugar values of 3.0 or less, which is less than the current position's sugar value. Therefore, moving would not increase welfare."
20,106,movement,[14,42],"The agent is currently at position [15, 42] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar value 3 at various distances. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are [15, 41], [14, 42], and [16, 42], all at distance 1. However, [15, 41] and [14, 42] are unoccupied, while [16, 42] is also unoccupied. Since all have the same sugar value and distance, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [14, 42] as it is unoccupied and adjacent, providing maximum welfare within vision range."
20,24,movement,[12,40],"The agent is currently at position [16,40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [12,40] and [12,39], both at a distance of 4.0 and 4.12 respectively. These positions are unoccupied and within the agent's vision range. Moving to [12,40] is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value)."
20,117,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [38,10] with a sugar value of 4.0. All visible positions within vision have sugar values of 3.0 or less, and many of these positions are occupied. Since the agent's current position has the highest sugar value available and moving to any other position would not increase welfare, the agent should not move."
20,57,movement,[12,39],"The agent is currently at position [13, 42] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are at [12, 39] with sugar 4.0, which is the maximum welfare position within vision and unoccupied. It is also the nearest position with maximum sugar value. Therefore, the agent should move to [12, 39]."
20,93,movement,[31,6],"The agent is currently at position [31,5] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values mostly 3. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is 3. The closest such positions are [32,5] and [31,6], both at distance 1. The agent chooses to move to [31,6] as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision range."
20,104,movement,[15,33],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0 (e.g., [15,33]). Therefore, the agent will move to [15,33]."
20,5,movement,[15,37],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.41 (positions [15,37], [17,37], and [17,39]). These positions are unoccupied and within vision range. Choosing the nearest one, [15,37], to maximize welfare and minimize movement distance."
20,88,movement,[11,41],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: (11,41) and (12,42). Choosing (11,41) as it is the first found nearest position with maximum welfare."
20,100,movement,[19,40],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [19,40] and [20,41]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [19,40] as it is directly adjacent and thus the closest position with maximum welfare."
20,60,movement,[32,7],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [32,7] and [31,8]. Choosing [32,7] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
20,31,movement,[17,39],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is lower than the sugar at the current position (1.0). However, the current position is occupied by the agent itself, and the agent can move to a nearby unoccupied position with sugar value 3.0, which is higher welfare. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 (position [17,39]). This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision. Therefore, the agent should move to position [17,39]."

2,62,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare (sugar value 1.0), there is no benefit in moving."
2,3,movement,[32,5],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [32,5] and [31,6] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are at the same distance (1.0). Choosing to move to [32,5] as it is one of the positions with maximum welfare and unoccupied."
2,24,movement,[15,42],"The agent is currently at position [15, 43] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 4.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 4.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41, specifically positions [15, 42], [16, 43], [14, 42], and [16, 42]. However, positions [15, 42] and [14, 42] are unoccupied and have sugar value 4.0 at distance 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [15, 42] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 42] to maximize welfare."
2,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
2,60,movement,[37,11],"The agent is currently at position [38, 11] with sugar 27. The neighboring occupied positions are [38,10], [32,11], [37,12], [37,15], and [40,15]. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have sugar value 4 except some farther ones with sugar 3 or less. The agent's vision is 6, so it can see all these positions. The agent should move to the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value, which is 4. The closest such positions are [37,11] and [37,10], both at distance 1 or 1.41. Choosing [37,11] as it is the closest with maximum sugar value 4 and unoccupied."
2,16,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, and the current position also has zero sugar. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
2,100,movement,[18,35],"The agent's current position has a sugar value of 1.0. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [18,35] and [19,36]. The agent will move to one of these nearest positions with maximum sugar value to maximize welfare."
2,52,movement,[34,13],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at position [34, 13], which is unoccupied and within vision distance 5.1. Other positions with sugar 3.0 are closer but have less sugar. Therefore, the agent moves to [34, 13] to maximize welfare."
2,43,movement,[45,8],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0. Among these, moving to position [45,8] is chosen arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare at the nearest distance."
2,37,movement,[34,9],"The agent is currently at position [32,9] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with higher sugar values (4) are available at positions like [34,9], [34,8], [34,10], etc. These positions are unoccupied and within the agent's vision range. The agent will move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value, which is [34,8] or [34,9] or [34,10] (all have sugar value 4 and distance approximately 2.24 to 2.0). Among these, [34,9] is the closest with distance 2.0. Therefore, the agent will move to [34,9]."
2,17,movement,[12,43],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [12, 43] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to staying at the current position with sugar value 1.0 or moving to [13, 44] with sugar value 2.0, which is also unoccupied but less sugar."
2,95,movement,[28,11],"The agent is currently at position [24, 11] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar values up to 3. The highest sugar value visible within vision is 3, at positions [28, 11], [28, 10], [29, 11], [29, 10], [29, 12], and [30, 11]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 4.0 and 4.12. All these positions are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [28, 11]."
2,74,movement,[40,1],"The agent can move to positions [40,1] or [41,2], both have sugar value 2.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is acceptable. The agent chooses to move to [40,1]."
2,81,movement,[29,8],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. The highest sugar value available in visible positions is 3.0 at position [29,8], but it is at distance 5.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 2.0 at distance 1.0 or 1.41, but these are lower sugar values. Since the agent's vision is 5, it can reach the position [29,8]. The agent chooses to move to [29,8] as it provides the maximum welfare (highest sugar) within vision and is unoccupied."
2,97,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar and are either occupied or not better than the current position. Therefore, the agent should not move."
2,5,movement,[9,37],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 3.0, but all positions with sugar 3.0 are at distances greater than 3.6. There are multiple positions with sugar 2.0 at distance 1.0 or 1.41, which are closer. Since the agent prioritizes maximum welfare and then nearest position, it chooses a position with sugar 3.0 despite being farther away. However, all sugar 3.0 positions are unoccupied and at distances around 3.6 to 6.0. The nearest sugar 3.0 position is at [9,37] with distance 3.61, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent moves to [9,37]."
2,73,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare equal to the neighbors, there is no benefit in moving."
2,89,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."

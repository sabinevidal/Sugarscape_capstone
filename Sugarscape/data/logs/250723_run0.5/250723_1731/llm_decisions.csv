27,37,movement,[36,7],"The agent is currently at position [36,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances 1.0 to 4.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [36,7], [35,9], and [37,9] at distances 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [36,7]."
27,42,movement,[29,1],"The agent can see several positions within its vision range. Among the unoccupied positions, the ones with the highest sugar value are at [29,1] and [30,1], both with sugar value 2.0. Both are unoccupied and within vision. The nearest position with maximum welfare is [29,1] at distance 1.0, so the agent will move there to maximize sugar intake."
27,129,movement,[29,13],"The agent is currently at position [28, 12] with sugar value 1. The nearest unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value (3) are at [29, 13], [30, 11], [30, 13], and [29, 14]. Among these, [29, 13] is the closest with a distance of 1.41. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while being the nearest option."
27,139,movement,[30,2],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0. The agent will move to the nearest such position to maximize welfare. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [30,2] and [31,3]. The agent chooses to move to [30,2] as it is the first in the list and equally beneficial."
27,8,movement,[33,10],"The agent is currently at position [33,11] with sugar value 1.0. All adjacent positions with higher sugar values (27.0, 22.5, 29.0, 53.0, etc.) are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available in unoccupied positions within vision range. Among these, the closest are at distance 1.0: [33,10] and [32,11]. The agent will move to [33,10] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare and unoccupied."
27,142,movement,[30,9],"The agent is currently at position [31,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at multiple positions: [30,9], [31,10], [32,6], [33,6], [30,11], [32,11], [33,5], and [35,9]. The nearest of these is at distance 1.41 (positions [30,9] and [32,6]). Choosing [30,9] as it is closer and unoccupied, the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
27,127,movement,[34,12],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [34,12] and [36,11]. Choosing [34,12] as it is the closest and unoccupied."
27,50,movement,[17,43],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except a few with 2.0 or 1.0, and all positions with sugar 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [17,43] and [16,44]. Choosing [17,43] as it is the first found with max sugar and minimum distance."
27,128,movement,[31,10],"The agent is currently at position [32,10] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [31,10], [32,11], and [30,11]. All these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 ([31,10] and [32,11]) and 2.24 ([30,11]). Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [31,10]."
27,2,movement,[19,38],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The position [19,38] is at distance 1.0 and unoccupied, so moving there maximizes welfare and is the nearest such position."
27,134,movement,[32,6],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 3.0 at positions [32,6], [33,6], and [33,5]. Among these, [32,6] is the closest with a distance of 2.0. Therefore, the agent moves to [32,6] to maximize its welfare."
27,130,movement,[15,36],"The agent is currently at position [16,36] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with the highest sugar value (3.0) are available at [15,36], [17,36], [15,35], [16,34], [14,36], [18,36], and others. Among these, [15,36] and [17,36] are the closest (distance 1.0) and unoccupied. Moving to either will maximize welfare. Choosing [15,36] arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar value."
27,116,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [16, 39] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. However, all positions with sugar value 3.0 are occupied or not accessible (occupied positions include [17, 39], [17, 38], [15, 40], [14, 39], [18, 39], [15, 41], [17, 41], [14, 41], [19, 39], [17, 36], [13, 40], [19, 40], [14, 36], [18, 36], [20, 39], [15, 35], [20, 38], [12, 40], [20, 40], [19, 42], [12, 37], [20, 41], [18, 43], [16, 34], [11, 39], [21, 39], [16, 44], [21, 38], [21, 40], [15, 44], [17, 44], [16, 33], [10, 39], [22, 39], [16, 45]). Therefore, the agent cannot move to a position with higher sugar value. The agent should not move and stay at the current position."
27,88,movement,[14,36],"The agent is currently at position [14, 37] with sugar value 1. All visible positions have sugar values of 3 or less, but the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions within vision is 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0 ([14, 36]) and distance 2.0 ([12, 37], [14, 39], [15, 35]). The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3 is [14, 36]. This position is unoccupied and within vision range. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 36] to maximize welfare."
27,144,movement,[33,2],"The agent is currently at position [34, 2] with sugar value 2.0. Nearby positions within vision are mostly occupied except for [33, 2], [34, 3], and [34, 1], all with sugar values of 2.0 or 1.0. Among these, [33, 2] and [34, 3] have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at distance 1, so the agent can move to either. Choosing [33, 2] as it is unoccupied and has maximum sugar value within vision."
27,111,movement,[38,5],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 1.41 at coordinates [38,5] and [40,5], and at distance 2.0 at [37,4]. Since [38,5] and [40,5] are equally close and have the maximum sugar, the agent can move to either. Choosing [38,5] arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare."
27,71,movement,[19,34],"The agent is currently at position [20, 35] with sugar value 1.0. There are multiple unoccupied positions within vision range that have a higher sugar value of 3.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances approximately 1.41 and 2.24. The agent will move to the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value, which is [19, 34] or [21, 36]. Both have the same sugar value and distance, but [19, 34] is chosen arbitrarily as it is the first in the list."
27,56,movement,[34,13],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with lower values. The agent is currently at position [35,13] with sugar value 1.0. The nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [34,13], [36,13], and [35,14]. Moving to any of these positions will increase the agent's sugar intake. Choosing [34,13] as it is the first in the list and equally beneficial."
27,133,movement,[10,37],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. All positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The agent chooses the nearest position with the maximum sugar value of 3.0. Among these, positions [10,37] and [10,39] are at distance 1.0 and unoccupied. The agent selects [10,37] as it is the first encountered with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
27,105,movement,[18,36],"The agent is currently at position [18, 37] with sugar value 1.0. All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. However, positions at [17, 36], [17, 38], and [18, 36] are unoccupied and have sugar value 3.0. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [18, 36] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [18, 36] to maximize welfare."

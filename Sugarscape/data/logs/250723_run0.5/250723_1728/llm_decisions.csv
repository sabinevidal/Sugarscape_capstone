26,137,movement,[14,34],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0, found at multiple positions: [14,34], [15,34], [14,37], [16,36], and [12,38]. Among these, [14,34] is the closest with a distance of 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [14,34]."
26,26,movement,[39,6],"The agent is currently at position [39,5] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values of 3.0 at positions [38,5], [39,6], and [40,6]. These positions have the highest sugar values available and are unoccupied. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [38,5] and [39,6] at distance 1.0. The agent will move to one of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [39,6] as it is directly adjacent and closer in terms of vertical movement."
26,129,movement,[28,12],"The agent is currently at position [28,11] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with higher sugar values are at [28,12], [30,12], [29,13], and [30,13], each with sugar value 3. Among these, [28,12] is the closest (distance 1.0) and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [28,12] to maximize welfare."
26,87,movement,[13,32],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [13,32], [14,33], and [13,34] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions would maximize welfare. Choosing [13,32] arbitrarily as the target position."
26,120,movement,[31,12],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [31,12] and [30,12]. Choosing the closest position with maximum welfare, the agent will move to [31,12]."
26,131,movement,[15,34],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at position [15, 34], which is at distance 1.0. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare within vision range. Therefore, the agent should move there."
26,7,movement,[14,29],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the positions [14,29], [16,29], and [15,30] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally good in terms of sugar value and distance, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [14,29] arbitrarily as the target position to maximize welfare."
26,101,movement,[36,6],"The agent is currently at position [37,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value available is 3.0 at multiple positions: [36,6], [35,7], [38,5], [40,7], [40,6], [38,10], [40,9], [41,6], [41,8], [38,11], [41,9], [35,11], and [42,8]. All these positions have sugar value 3.0, but some are occupied. The agent must move to an unoccupied position with maximum sugar value and minimum distance. Checking the occupied positions, [35,7] is unoccupied and has sugar 3.0 at distance 2.24, [36,6] is unoccupied with sugar 3.0 at distance 1.41, and [38,5] is unoccupied with sugar 3.0 at distance 2.24. The closest is [36,6] with sugar 3.0 and distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,6]."
26,57,movement,[10,40],"The agent is currently at position [11, 40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. Several positions have this sugar value, but the closest one is at distance 1.0, position [10, 40]. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while minimizing movement distance."
26,141,movement,[28,8],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [28,8], [30,12], [29,13], [30,13], and [29,14]. Among these, the nearest position with maximum sugar is [28,8] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [28,8]."
26,143,movement,[20,36],"The agent is currently at position [19, 34] with sugar value 2.0. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are [20, 36] at distance 2.24 and [16, 36] at distance 3.61. Since [20, 36] is closer and unoccupied, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
26,30,movement,[12,32],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to one of these closest positions with maximum sugar value to maximize welfare."
26,125,movement,[12,38],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. Among these positions, the closest ones with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 2.0 (position [12,38]) and 2.24 (position [14,37]). The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [12,38]."
26,88,movement,[14,37],"The agent is currently at position [14, 38] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values mostly 3 or 2. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are [14, 37], [13, 39], [16, 38], and [14, 40]. Among these, [14, 37] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 37] to maximize welfare."
26,42,movement,[28,1],"The agent can see several positions within its vision range. The highest sugar value among unoccupied positions is 2.0 at position [28,1]. Positions [31,1] and [29,2] are occupied, so they are not considered. The agent is currently at position [29,1] with sugar value 1.0. Moving to [28,1] will increase the agent's sugar intake from 1.0 to 2.0, so it is beneficial to move there."
26,118,movement,[18,42],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [18,42]. Moving there maximizes welfare and is unoccupied."
26,85,movement,[40,9],"The agent is currently at position [39,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances ranging from 1.0 to 6.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [40,9] and [38,10], both at distance 1.0 or slightly more. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [40,9]."
26,23,movement,[36,3],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 2.0. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum welfare, which is any adjacent position with sugar value 2.0. Choosing position [36,3] as it is unoccupied and adjacent."
26,127,movement,[35,12],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can move to any unoccupied position within this range. Among the visible unoccupied positions, all have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [35,12]. Moving there maximizes welfare and is the closest option."
26,103,movement,[34,11],"The agent is currently at position [33,9] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [34,11], [35,7], and [35,11]. The nearest of these is [35,7] and [34,11] both at distance approximately 2.83 and 2.24 respectively. Position [34,11] is closer and unoccupied, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
26,67,movement,[9,41],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, but the agent is currently on a position with sugar value 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41 and are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest such position at [9, 41] which has sugar value 3.0 and is unoccupied, maximizing welfare."
26,114,movement,[35,7],"The agent is currently at position [31,7] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values mostly 2 or 3.

37,147,movement,[38,1],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have equal sugar value of 2.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0: [38,1] and [37,2]. Choosing [38,1] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and nearest distance."
37,81,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is lower than the agent's current sugar level of 69.0. Moving to any of these positions would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should stay in its current position."
37,58,movement,[30,13],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. Several positions with sugar 3.0 are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0 (position [30,13]) and 1.41 (positions [30,12], [32,12]). The closest position with maximum sugar is [30,13]. Therefore, the agent should move to [30,13]."
37,103,movement,[37,15],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available sugar in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: (37,15) and (36,16). Both are unoccupied. Choosing (37,15) as it is directly east and equally close."

However, many of these positions are occupied by other agents or out of immediate reach. The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 2.0 is [36,2], which is at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,2] to maximize welfare."
37,101,movement,[34,16],"All nearby positions with higher sugar values are occupied. The visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.41 and 2.0. The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value is [34,16] with sugar 3.0 at distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,16]."
37,55,movement,[39,8],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are not occupied. The highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [39,8], [37,9], and [39,10]. Among these, [39,8] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent moves to [39,8] to maximize its welfare."
37,160,movement,[31,10],"The agent is currently at position [29,7] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values are all occupied or have lower sugar values. The highest unoccupied sugar value within vision is 3.0 at positions [31,10], [29,11], [30,11], [31,11], and [30,12]. Among these, [31,10] is the closest at distance 3.61. Therefore, the agent should move to [31,10] to maximize welfare."
37,46,movement,[15,42],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [15,42] and [15,44]. Both are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value visible. Choosing the closest position [15,42] to maximize welfare and minimize movement distance."
37,31,movement,[11,37],"The agent is currently at position [11, 38] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied or out of reach. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [11, 37], [12, 38], and [11, 39], all at distance 1.0. Moving to any of these positions will maximize welfare. Choosing [11, 37] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."

Choosing the closest one, [11,39], to maximize welfare and minimize movement distance."
37,154,movement,[29,11],"The agent is currently at position [28,7] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values mostly 2 or 3. The highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3 at positions [29,11] and [30,11], both at a distance of about 4.12 and 4.47 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar value is [29,11]. Therefore, the agent should move to [29,11]."
37,119,movement,[42,9],"The agent is currently at position [42,8] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. These positions are at distances ranging from 1.0 to 4.47. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [42,9] at distance 1.0, which is unoccupied.

37,131,movement,[14,35],"The agent can move to positions with sugar values of 3.0 at distances 1.0 and 1.41, which are higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar are at [14,35] and [14,36]. Both are unoccupied and have the highest sugar value within vision. The agent chooses to move to [14,35] as it is the closest position with maximum welfare."

The maximum sugar value available in these positions is 3.0, found at multiple positions such as [30,11], [31,11], [32,11], and [30,12]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 2.0 (e.g., [30,11]). The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with the maximum sugar value, which is [30,11]."
37,125,movement,[16,38],"The agent is currently at position [17,39] with sugar value 1. All visible positions have sugar value 3 or less, but the maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are [16,38] at distance 1.41 and [19,39] at distance 2.0. The closest position with maximum sugar value 3 is [16,38].

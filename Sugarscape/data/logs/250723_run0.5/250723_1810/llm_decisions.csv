35,160,movement,[27,9],"The agent is currently at position [27,10] with sugar value 2.0. All nearby positions within vision have sugar value 2.0, but many are occupied. The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 2.0 are [27,9], [26,10], [27,11], [26,9], [28,9], [26,11], [27,8], [25,10], [27,12], [26,8], [25,9], [25,11], [26,12], [28,12], etc. Among these, the closest with sugar 2.0 is at distance 1.0, for example [27,9], [26,10], or [27,11]. The agent chooses to move to [27,9] as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum welfare (sugar 2.0)."
35,118,movement,[8,42],"The agent is currently at position [8, 41] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3, located at positions [8, 42], [9, 43], [10, 43], [9, 44], [11, 43], [10, 44], [11, 44], and [10, 45]. Among these, the nearest position with sugar value 3 is [8, 42] at distance 1.0, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [8, 42] to maximize welfare."
35,26,movement,[39,4],"The agent is currently at position [39,5] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [39,4] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is at distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare as per the movement rule."
35,66,movement,[37,6],"The agent is currently at position [37,7] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 4, and it can see several unoccupied positions with sugar values of 3 at distances 1.0 to 4.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are at [37,6] and [36,6], both at distance 1. The agent chooses to move to [37,6] as it is the closest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) and is unoccupied."
35,46,movement,[14,43],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.41, such as [14,43]. Moving to [14,43] maximizes welfare by moving to the highest sugar value nearby while being unoccupied and closest."
35,58,movement,[31,12],"The agent is currently at position [30, 12] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 2.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The unoccupied positions with sugar value 2.0 are [31, 12], [29, 13], [31, 13], [30, 10], [28, 12], [28, 13], [30, 9], [27, 12], and [30, 15]. The nearest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value is [31, 12] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [31, 12]."
35,112,movement,[15,36],"The agent is currently at position [16,36]. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0, but many of these positions are occupied. The unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are [15,36], [14,36], [14,37], [19,36], [13,37], [19,34], [18,39], [20,36], [20,35], [20,37], [17,40], [12,38], [21,36], [21,37], and [17,41]. The nearest among these is [15,36] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [15,36] to maximize welfare by moving to the nearest position with the highest sugar value available."
35,124,movement,[34,10],"The agent is currently at position [32, 11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at multiple positions: [34, 10], [32, 14], [31, 8], [36, 12], [34, 7], [36, 13]. Checking if these positions are unoccupied, none of these positions are listed as occupied. The nearest among these is [31, 8] at distance 3.0, and [34, 10] at distance 2.24. Since [34, 10] is closer and has the maximum sugar value of 3.0, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
35,85,movement,[37,10],"The agent is currently at position [38, 11] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance approximately 1.41, such as [37, 10], [37, 12], and [39, 12]. Choosing the closest one, [37, 10], which is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value within vision, will maximize the agent's welfare."
35,147,movement,[38,1],"The agent's vision is 2, and it can move to any unoccupied position within this range. The positions [38,1], [37,2], [38,2], and [39,1] all have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar are [38,1] and [37,2], both at distance 1. The agent chooses to move to [38,1] as it is the first found position with maximum welfare and minimum distance."
35,84,movement,[41,6],"The agent is currently at position [38,4] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3 at positions [36,6], [41,6], and [38,9]. Among these, [36,6] is the closest at a distance of 2.83. However, [36,6] is occupied by agent 66. The other two positions with sugar 3 are [41,6] and [38,9], both unoccupied. Between these, [41,6] is closer (3.61) than [38,9] (5.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [41,6] to maximize welfare while moving to the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar."
35,60,movement,[36,13],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 2.0 (e.g., [36,13]). Since these positions are unoccupied, moving to one of them maximizes welfare. I choose to move to [36,13] as it is the nearest position with maximum sugar value available."
35,132,movement,[34,7],"The agent is currently at position [33,7] with sugar value 1. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3 at positions [34,7] and [34,6]. Both positions are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar value is [34,7] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,7] to maximize welfare."
35,121,movement,[32,14],"The agent is currently at position [30, 13]. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value available in an unoccupied position is 3.0 at positions [32, 14], [31, 16], [32, 16], [33, 16]. The closest of these is [32, 14] with a distance of 2.24. Moving there maximizes welfare by moving to the highest sugar value position within vision that is unoccupied."
35,119,movement,[41,7],"The agent is currently at position [39,6] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value (3.0) within vision range are [41,7], [36,6], [38,9], [42,8], [41,9], [40,10], [42,9], and [41,10]. Among these, [41,7] is the closest with a distance of 2.24 and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [41,7] to maximize welfare."
35,135,movement,[33,2],"The agent can see several unoccupied positions within its vision range, all with a sugar value of 2.0, which is higher than the sugar value of its current position (1.0). Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [33,2], [32,3], and [33,4]. The agent will move to one of these positions to maximize welfare. Choosing [33,2] as it is directly adjacent and provides maximum sugar value."
35,93,movement,[31,8],"The agent is currently at position [31,4] with sugar 58.0. Among visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at position [31,8], which is unoccupied and within vision range (distance 4.0). Moving there maximizes welfare compared to staying or moving to other positions with sugar values of 2.0 or 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [31,8]."
35,109,movement,[40,5],"The agent is currently at position [40,6] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with higher sugar values (3.0) are at [42,8], [41,9], [36,6], and [40,10], but these are all beyond the agent's vision range or occupied. Within vision and unoccupied, the highest sugar value is 2.0 at multiple positions such as [40,5], [40,7], [41,5], [40,4], [38,6], [42,6], [41,4], [38,5], [42,5], [42,7], [42,4], [38,8], [40,3], [43,6], [40,9], [39,3], [41,3], [37,5], [43,5], [43,7], [40,2], and [44,6]. Among these, the closest with sugar 2.0 is [40,5] and [40,7] at distance 1.0. Choosing [40,5] as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar value within vision."

0,43,movement,[46,9],"The agent has a vision of 3 and can see several positions with sugar value 2.0 at distances 2.0 to 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value 2.0 are at distance 2.0: positions [46,9], [46,8], and [46,10]. All these positions are unoccupied. The agent will choose the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [46,9]."
0,81,movement,[20,8],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 1.0, which is the maximum available sugar in the visible area. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [20,8]. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare. Therefore, the agent should move to [20,8]."
0,8,movement,[33,21],"The agent is currently at position [33, 22] with sugar value 1.0. There are multiple nearby positions within vision range that have a higher sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41, for example [33, 21], [32, 21], and [34, 21]. Moving to any of these positions will maximize welfare by increasing sugar intake. The agent will move to the closest position with maximum sugar value, which is [33, 21]."
0,50,movement,[14,25],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see several positions with sugar value 1.0 at distance 4 or slightly more. All these positions are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value visible within the agent's vision. The agent will move to the nearest such position to maximize welfare. The nearest position with sugar 1.0 is at [14, 25] with distance 4.0."
0,63,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
0,39,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have zero sugar value, so there is no welfare gain from moving. The agent will stay in place."
0,42,movement,[24,13],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 2.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distances 1.0 and 1.41. The closest position with maximum sugar is [24,13] at distance 1.0, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
0,67,movement,[12,25],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 1.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 1.0 are at distance 2.83 (position [12,25]). Since the agent cannot move to occupied positions and all other positions with sugar 1.0 are farther, moving to [12,25] maximizes welfare and is the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar."
0,57,movement,[4,38],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 2.0 within its vision range. All these positions have the maximum sugar value available in the visible area and are unoccupied. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 3.0 (e.g., [4,38]). Moving to the nearest position with maximum sugar value maximizes the agent's welfare according to the movement rule."
0,98,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar and are either occupied or offer no better welfare than the current position. Therefore, the agent should not move."
0,65,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0. Since the current position [2,36] is already occupied by the agent and has the maximum welfare (sugar value), and moving to any adjacent position does not increase welfare, the agent will not move."
0,37,movement,[28,8],"The agent is currently at position [24,8] with sugar value 2.0. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see several positions with sugar value 3.0 at distances around 4 to 5.1. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are [28,8] at distance 4.0 and [28,9] at distance 4.12. Both positions are unoccupied. Moving to [28,8] is the best choice as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) within vision and unoccupied."
0,32,movement,null,"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 2.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision range. The current position [25,41] is unoccupied and has sugar value 2.0, so the agent will not move to avoid unnecessary movement."
0,25,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
0,88,movement,[13,47],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 within its vision range. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 3.0 (positions [13,47], [14,47], [13,46], [12,46], [14,46]). All these positions are unoccupied. The agent will choose the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 3.0. Among these, the position [13,47] is chosen as it is directly south and closest in terms of coordinates."
0,2,movement,[11,46],"The agent is currently at position [10, 47] with sugar value 2.0. There are multiple nearby unoccupied positions within vision range that have a higher sugar value of 3.0. Since the movement rule is to move to the nearest position producing maximum welfare, the agent should move to the closest position with sugar value 3.0. The closest such position is [11, 46] at distance 1.41, which is unoccupied and has the maximum sugar value available within vision."
0,22,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent will stay in place."
0,100,movement,[19,34],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available in the visible positions. Among these, the closest unoccupied position with sugar 3.0 is at coordinates [19,34] with a distance of 2.24. The position [19,35] is occupied, so it cannot move there. Therefore, the agent will move to [19,34] to maximize welfare while moving the shortest distance."
0,31,movement,[18,39],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are unoccupied. The maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 4.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The agent chooses to move to position [18, 39], which has sugar value 4.0 and is at distance 1.0, the closest maximum welfare position."
0,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have sugar value 0 except the current position which also has sugar value 0. There are no unoccupied positions with higher sugar value within vision range. Therefore, the agent should not move."
0,17,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have the same sugar value of 3.0. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare, the agent will not move."
0,26,movement,[44,17],"Among the visible positions, the maximum sugar value is 2.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0: [44,17] and [43,18]. Both are unoccupied and equally close. Choosing [44,17] arbitrarily as the target position to maximize welfare."
0,27,movement,[38,1],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see three positions within that range: its current position (37,1) with sugar value 2.0, and two adjacent positions (38,1) and (37,2) both with sugar value 2.0. The current position is occupied by the agent itself, so it is not considered for movement. The position (36,1) is occupied by another agent, so it is not available. Both (38,1) and (37,2) have the same sugar value and are unoccupied. The agent can move to either position. Since both have equal welfare, the agent can choose to move to either. Choosing (38,1) arbitrarily as the target position."
0,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. There is no benefit in moving to any other position."
0,89,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value and are unoccupied, including the current position. Therefore, there is no welfare gain by moving."
0,90,movement,[23,32],"The agent is currently at position [26, 30] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 2.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 2.0 are at distances approximately 3.61 to 6.0. The closest such positions are [23, 32] and [24, 33] at distance 3.61. Choosing [23, 32] as the target position to maximize welfare and minimize distance."
0,47,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."

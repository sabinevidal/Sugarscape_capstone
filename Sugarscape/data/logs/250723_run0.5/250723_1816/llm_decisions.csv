37,109,movement,[37,3],"The agent is currently at position [37,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at multiple positions: [37,3], [38,4], [35,5], [39,5], [37,7], and [37,8]. However, positions [35,5], [39,5], and [37,7] are within vision but [37,8] is at distance 4.0. Checking if these positions are unoccupied: [37,3] and [38,4] are unoccupied and closest with distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to one of these positions with sugar value 3.0 and distance 1.0. Choosing [37,3] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
37,162,movement,[18,41],"The agent is currently at position [17, 42] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [18, 41], [14, 41], and [14, 40]. The nearest of these is [18, 41] at distance 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [18, 41] to maximize welfare."
37,17,movement,[10,30],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [10, 30] and [11, 31] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. Since both are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, moving to [10, 30] is chosen arbitrarily as it is to the left, maintaining variety in movement."
37,52,movement,[36,8],"The agent is currently at position [38,6] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision are evaluated for maximum sugar value. The position [36,8] has the highest sugar value of 4.0 and is unoccupied. It is also within the agent's vision range (distance 2.83). Therefore, the agent should move to [36,8] to maximize welfare."
37,52,reproduction,[37],"Agent 52 is male, age 38, with sufficient sugar (72) above the minimum required for reproduction (8). There is one eligible partner, agent 37, who is female, age 37, and also fertile. Both agents have empty neighboring positions (agent 52 has [35,8] and [37,8], agent 37 has [35,9] and [37,9]), satisfying the spatial requirement for reproduction. Since agent 52 can have up to 4 partners but only one eligible partner is available, reproduction with agent 37 is chosen. This ensures continuation of lineage and efficient use of resources."
37,12,movement,[32,4],"The agent is currently at position [32,6] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0 at multiple positions ([32,4], [31,4], [30,7], [33,3], [35,5], [33,9], [29,8], [34,9], [31,10], [29,9], [35,9], [32,11], [37,7], [31,11], [33,11], [32,12]). The nearest of these is at distance 2.0, for example [32,4] or [31,4]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [32,4]."
37,167,movement,[14,40],"The agent is currently at position [16, 38] with a sugar value of 3.0. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values are [14, 40] and [14, 41], both with sugar value 4.0 and distances 2.83 and 3.61 respectively. Both positions are unoccupied. Among these, [14, 40] is closer. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 40] to maximize welfare."
37,26,movement,[38,4],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [38,4] and [39,5] have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at distance 1.0, so either can be chosen. Moving to [38,4] is chosen arbitrarily as it provides maximum welfare and is unoccupied."
37,168,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [34,3] with a sugar value of 3.0. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values are all occupied or out of vision range. The agent's vision is 6, and the highest sugar values within vision are 3.0 at its current position and adjacent positions, but those are occupied. Therefore, the agent should not move as no unoccupied position within vision offers higher welfare."
37,96,movement,[14,41],"The agent is currently at position [12, 39] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are at [14, 41] with sugar 4.0. This position is within the agent's vision range and unoccupied, so moving there maximizes welfare."
37,107,movement,[29,1],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the positions [29,1], [28,2], and [29,3] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all have equal sugar and are at the same distance, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. I choose to move to [29,1] arbitrarily among these options."
37,153,movement,[11,35],"The agent is currently at position [10, 35] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at various distances. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [11, 35], [9, 36], and [11, 36], all at distance 1.0 or 1.41. Choosing the closest one, [11, 35], which is unoccupied and has maximum sugar value within vision range."
37,75,movement,[28,2],"The agent can see three positions within its vision range: its current position [28,1] with sugar 1.0, position [28,2] with sugar 2.0, and position [27,1] with sugar 1.0. The position [29,1] is occupied and cannot be moved to. Among the unoccupied positions, [28,2] has the highest sugar value (2.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [28,2] to maximize welfare."
37,169,movement,[35,5],"The agent is currently at position [33,6] with sugar value 3.0. All visible positions have sugar values of 3.0 or less, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances 2.24 ([35,5]) and 2.83 ([31,4]). Among these, [35,5] is closer. Moving there maximizes welfare while being the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value."
37,53,movement,[34,15],"The agent is currently at position [35,15] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. These positions are at distances ranging from 1.0 to 3.16. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are [34,15] and [35,16], both at distance 1.0. Choosing the closest position with maximum sugar value, the agent should move to [34,15]."
37,56,movement,[36,11],"The agent is currently at position [36,12] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar is [36,11] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,11] to maximize welfare."
37,67,movement,[10,39],"The agent is currently at position [9, 39] with sugar value 1.0. All adjacent and visible positions with higher sugar values (3.0) are unoccupied and within vision range. Since multiple positions have the same maximum sugar value of 3.0, the agent chooses the nearest one, which is at distance 1.0. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are [10, 39] and [10, 40]. Among these, [10, 39] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent will move to [10, 39]."
37,150,movement,[33,6],"The agent is currently at position [35,6] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [33,6] and [37,7], both with sugar value 3. Among these, [33,6] is closer (distance 2.0) compared to [37,7] (distance 2.24). Therefore, the agent should move to [33,6] to maximize welfare while minimizing distance."
37,71,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is less than the agent's current sugar level of 25.5. Moving to any of these positions would not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."
37,135,movement,[33,3],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [33,3] and [31,4] have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at distances 1.0 and 2.0 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [33,3]. Therefore, the agent should move to [33,3]."

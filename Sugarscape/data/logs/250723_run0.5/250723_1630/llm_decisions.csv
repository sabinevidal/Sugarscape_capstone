9,34,movement,[9,31],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [9,31] and [8,32] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is equally good. Choosing to move to [9,31]."
9,8,movement,[35,14],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, for example [35,14]. Moving to the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar) is optimal. Therefore, the agent will move to [35,14]."
9,23,movement,[37,3],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [37,3] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare as per the movement rule."
9,55,movement,[32,5],"The agent has a vision of 3 and can see multiple positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value visible in unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [32,5], [32,6], [31,7], and [30,8]. However, [31,7] and [30,7] are occupied, so [31,7] is not available. Among the unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0, [32,5] is at distance 2.0, [32,6] at 2.24, and [30,8] at 3.0. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [32,5]. Therefore, the agent should move to [32,5]."
9,49,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
9,40,movement,[19,40],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, specifically [19,40], [19,39], and [19,41]. Choosing the closest position with maximum welfare, the agent will move to [19,40]."
9,10,movement,null,"The agent's current position and all visible positions within its vision range have a sugar value of 0, except for a distant position at [39,1] with sugar value 2, which is too far to move to within the vision range. Since no nearby unoccupied position offers higher sugar value, the agent will not move."
9,15,movement,[32,11],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the position [32,11] has the highest sugar value of 4.0, which is greater than the sugar value of its current position (1.0). This position is also unoccupied and within the agent's vision. Therefore, the agent moves to [32,11] to maximize its welfare."
9,74,movement,[33,1],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [33,1], [35,1], and [34,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. All are at distance 1.0, so the agent can move to any of these to maximize welfare. Choosing [33,1] arbitrarily among these equally optimal options."
9,57,movement,[11,41],"The agent is currently at position [12, 41] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3, but many of these positions are occupied by other agents. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 are [11, 41] and [11, 42], both at distance 1. The agent will move to [11, 41] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) that is unoccupied."
9,52,movement,[31,10],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. Among these, the closest positions at distance 1.0 are [31,10]. This position is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare, so the agent should move there."
9,95,movement,[34,10],"The agent is currently at position [35,10] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 to [34,10]. Moving to [34,10] provides the maximum welfare (highest sugar) at the shortest distance."
9,6,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the agent is already on a position with maximum welfare (sugar value 1.0) and all other positions with the same sugar value are at least 1 unit away, the agent will not move to avoid unnecessary movement."
9,75,movement,[35,1],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [35,1], [37,1], and [36,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally good in terms of sugar and distance, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [35,1] arbitrarily as the target position."
9,7,movement,[12,34],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [12,34] and [11,35] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are at distance 1.0, so either is equally good. Choosing to move to [12,34]."
9,90,movement,[13,37],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible range. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [13,37] and [14,38]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [13,37] as it is directly adjacent and equally beneficial."
9,64,movement,[34,8],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0 sugar. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. Among these, position [34,8] is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,8] to maximize welfare."
9,72,movement,[37,10],"The agent is currently at position [36,9] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, but all these positions are unoccupied and at various distances. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are at distances 1.41 to 3.61. The closest position with sugar 3 is at [37,10] with distance 1.41, which is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while minimizing movement distance."
9,50,movement,[15,44],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3, which is the maximum available in the visible area. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0, for example [15,44]. Moving to any of these positions will maximize welfare. Choosing [15,44] as it is the closest and directly adjacent."
9,67,movement,[14,38],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.41 (positions [14,38]) and at distance 2.0 (positions [11,39], [15,39]). The closest position with maximum sugar is [14,38]. This position is unoccupied and within vision range, so the agent should move there to maximize welfare."
9,53,movement,[34,6],"The agent is currently at position [34,7] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, but all these positions are unoccupied and at a distance of 1 to 3. The agent should move to one of these positions with sugar value 3 to maximize welfare. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3 are [34,6], [33,7], [35,6], and [33,8], all at distance 1 or 1.41. Choosing [34,6] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
9,46,movement,[17,35],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [18,34], [17,35], and [19,35]. All these positions are unoccupied. Choosing [17,35] as it is unoccupied and provides maximum welfare at the nearest distance."

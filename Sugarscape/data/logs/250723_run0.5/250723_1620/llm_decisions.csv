6,90,movement,[17,36],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [17,36] and [18,37]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [17,36] as it is directly adjacent and closer in terms of coordinates."
6,46,movement,[18,37],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0, specifically positions [18,37] and [19,38]. Both are unoccupied and equally close. Choosing to move to [18,37] as it is directly adjacent and provides maximum welfare within vision range."
6,40,movement,[19,43],"The agent is currently at position [19, 42] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 3, but many of these positions are unoccupied and at a distance of 1 to 3. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 are [19, 43], [18, 41], and [18, 43]. Among these, [19, 43] is the nearest (distance 1). Therefore, the agent should move to [19, 43] to maximize welfare."
6,62,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is the maximum welfare available. Since the current position also has a sugar value of 1.0 and is unoccupied, the agent will not move as there is no better position to move to."
6,39,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent should stay in place."
6,68,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0 except the current position which also has 0 sugar. Therefore, there is no better position to move to for increasing welfare."
6,96,movement,[12,42],"The agent is currently at position [13, 42] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 5, and it can see multiple positions with sugar value 3 within its vision range. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are at distance 1 (positions [12, 42] and [13, 43]). Both positions are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to [12, 42] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
6,30,movement,[11,41],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [12,40] and [11,41] have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at a distance of 1, which is the nearest distance for maximum welfare. I choose to move to [11,41] as it is unoccupied and provides maximum sugar value at the nearest distance."
6,56,movement,[37,10],"The agent is currently at position [38, 10] with sugar value 1.0. All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [37, 10] and [39, 10]. Both are unoccupied and have the maximum welfare (sugar value) available within vision. The agent will move to the nearest such position, choosing [37, 10]."
6,19,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
6,95,movement,[31,9],"The agent is currently at position [31,10] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 within its vision range. Since all these positions have the same maximum sugar value of 3, the agent will move to the nearest one to maximize welfare. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 are [31,9] and [30,10], both at distance 1. The agent will choose to move to [31,9] as it is directly adjacent and closer in terms of coordinates."
6,64,movement,[32,5],"The agent is currently at position [31,6] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are all 3, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 are [32,5] and [30,7], both at a distance of approximately 1.41. Choosing [32,5] as it is closer to the agent's current position and unoccupied, providing maximum welfare within vision range."
6,84,movement,[31,12],"The agent is currently at position [32, 12] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have a maximum sugar value of 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0: [31, 12] and [32, 13]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [31, 12]."
6,67,movement,[11,35],"The agent has a vision of 5 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 within its vision range. All these positions have the same sugar value, so the agent will choose the nearest one to maximize welfare. The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is at [11, 35], which is at distance 1.0. This position is unoccupied and provides the maximum welfare within the agent's vision. Therefore, the agent should move to [11, 35]."
6,73,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare equal to the neighbors, there is no benefit in moving."
6,26,movement,[42,12],"The agent is currently at position [44, 12] with a sugar value of 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [42, 12] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake."
6,53,movement,[37,5],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The agent will move to the nearest such position to maximize welfare. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [37,5], [36,6], and [38,6]. Among these, [37,5] is directly north, [36,6] is west, and [38,6] is east. The agent chooses to move to [37,5] as it is the closest and directly adjacent position with maximum sugar value."
6,70,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
6,51,movement,[38,7],"The agent is currently at position [38,8] with sugar value 1.0. All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, but many positions with sugar value 3.0 are available and unoccupied. The agent should move to the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value, which is 3.0. Among these, the closest positions are at distance 1.0: [38,7] and [39,8]. Choosing [38,7] as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
6,80,movement,[34,14],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available. Among these, the nearest positions at distance 1.0 are [34,14] and [35,15]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [34,14] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
6,31,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, which is lower than the sugar values of occupied neighboring positions. Since the agent cannot move to occupied positions and all unoccupied positions have low sugar values, moving does not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should stay in its current position."
6,59,movement,[16,35],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among the positions with sugar 3.0, the nearest ones are at distance 1.0: [16,35] and [15,36]. Both are unoccupied and have the maximum sugar value visible. Choosing [16,35] as the target position as it is adjacent and unoccupied."
6,14,movement,[13,37],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value. Among visible positions, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [13,37], [12,37], and [14,39]. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest position with sugar 3.0 is [13,37] at distance 1.0, so the agent moves there to maximize welfare."
6,97,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
6,72,movement,null,"The agent is currently at position [37, 11] with sugar 14. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, which is less than the current sugar at the agent's position. Therefore, moving to any of these positions would not increase the agent's welfare. Hence, the agent should not move."

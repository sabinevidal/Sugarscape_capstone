24,74,movement,[27,2],"The agent can move to either position [27, 2] or [28, 3], both have the maximum sugar value of 2.0 among unoccupied positions within vision range. Both are at distance 1, so the agent can choose either. I choose [27, 2] arbitrarily."
24,120,movement,[32,11],"The agent is currently at position [34, 11] with sugar value 1.0. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 within its vision range. All these positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and at various distances. The nearest position with maximum sugar value (3.0) is at distance 2.0, for example, position [32, 11]. Moving there will maximize the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake. Therefore, the agent should move to [32, 11]."
24,105,movement,[18,34],"The agent is currently at position [15,34] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 2 or 3, but many of the positions with sugar 3 are occupied or farther away. The closest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value is [18,34] with sugar 3 and distance 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare within the agent's vision and is unoccupied."
24,81,movement,[30,11],"The agent is currently at position [30,10] with sugar value 1.0. All adjacent positions with higher sugar values (e.g., [30,9] with 50.0, [30,8] with 54.0, [29,10] with 25.0, [31,10] with 18.5) are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions within vision have sugar value 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The agent will move to the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value, which is [30,11] with sugar 3.0 and distance 1.0."
24,8,movement,[33,6],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the positions [33,6], [33,8], and [32,8] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Among these, [33,6] and [33,8] are closest at a distance of approximately 1.41. The agent chooses to move to [33,6] as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar) and is unoccupied."
24,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
24,38,movement,[33,3],"The agent is currently at position [33, 2] with sugar value 1. Nearby unoccupied positions within vision are [33, 3], [34, 3], [35, 2], [32, 1], and [32, 3]. Among these, positions [33, 3], [34, 3], and [35, 2] have the highest sugar value of 2.0. The closest position with maximum sugar is [33, 3] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [33, 3]."
24,87,movement,[14,33],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [14,33] and [14,35] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent is currently at [14,34] with sugar value 1.0. Moving to either [14,33] or [14,35] will maximize welfare by increasing sugar intake. Choosing [14,33] arbitrarily as it is equally beneficial."
24,109,movement,[40,12],"The agent has a vision of 4 and can see multiple positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Since the agent must move to the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value), it will choose one of the positions with sugar value 3.0 at distance 1.0. Among these, the positions [40,12], [39,13], and [41,13] are unoccupied and closest. The agent will move to [40,12] as it is the first encountered position with maximum sugar value and minimum distance."
24,23,movement,[37,4],"Among the visible positions, [37,4] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. It is also within vision range (distance 1). Moving there maximizes welfare."
25,130,movement,[14,35],"The agent is currently at position [14, 36] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. These positions are [14, 35], [13, 36], [13, 35], [12, 36], [14, 38], [12, 35], [13, 38], [15, 38], [13, 33], [11, 35], [17, 35], [17, 37], [15, 39], [11, 38], [18, 35], [18, 37], [9, 36], and [19, 36]. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [14, 35] and [13, 36]. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar, the agent will move to [14, 35]."
25,87,movement,[13,33],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, the position [13, 33] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other positions with sugar values of 2.0 or 1.0 at the current position."
25,52,movement,[33,8],"The agent is currently at position [35,10] with sugar 50. The visible positions within vision are mostly occupied or have low sugar values (3 or 4). The highest sugar value in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at position [33,8]. This position is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to staying in place or moving to other positions with sugar 3.0 or less."
25,124,movement,[31,5],"The agent is currently at position [31,6] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for a few with 2.0. The agent should move to the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value, which is 3.0. The closest such positions are [31,5] and [31,7], both at distance 1.0. The agent can choose either; here, it moves to [31,5]."
25,105,movement,[18,35],"The agent is currently at position [18, 34] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have a sugar value of 3, which is the maximum welfare available nearby. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are [18, 35], [17, 33], [17, 35], and [19, 35], all at distance 1 or approximately 1.41. Choosing the nearest position with maximum sugar value, the agent will move to [18, 35]."
25,104,movement,[17,33],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 or less, with the maximum sugar value being 3.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.41 (positions [17,33] and [17,35]). The agent chooses to move to one of these closest positions with maximum sugar value to maximize welfare."
25,141,movement,null,"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except a few with 2.0 or 1.0, and the current position also has 3.0 sugar. Since moving to any other position with the same sugar value does not increase welfare and the current position is unoccupied, the agent should stay in place."
25,93,movement,[31,4],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The maximum sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [31,4], [30,5], [34,3], and [30,7]. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are [31,4] (distance 1.41) and [30,5] (distance 2.0). The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar, which is [31,4]."
25,112,movement,[16,41],"The agent is currently at position [17, 41] with sugar 23.5. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [16, 41] and [18, 41], both at distance 1. Moving to either would increase the agent's sugar intake. Since both have equal sugar and distance, moving to [16, 41] is chosen arbitrarily as it is unoccupied and closest with maximum welfare."
25,55,movement,[34,4],"The agent is currently at position [33,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0 at positions [34,4], [34,3], and [35,5]. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are [34,4] and [34,3], both at distance 1.0 and 1.41 respectively. The closest is [34,4]. Therefore, the agent should move to [34,4] to maximize welfare."

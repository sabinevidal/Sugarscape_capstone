4,40,movement,[18,42],"The agent is currently at position [17, 41] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions all have a sugar value of 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distances 1.41 and 2.0. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3 is [18, 42] at distance 1.41, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [18, 42] to maximize welfare."
4,49,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
4,12,movement,[34,7],"The agent is currently at position [35,8] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, but all these positions are unoccupied and at various distances. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3 are at distances ranging from 1.41 to 3.61. The closest such position is [34,7] at distance 1.41. Moving there will maximize the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake while minimizing movement cost."
4,83,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Moving to any other position does not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent will not move."
4,71,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is equal to the sugar value of the current position. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare (sugar value 1.0), there is no benefit in moving."
4,48,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
4,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Moving to any other position does not increase welfare. Therefore, the agent should not move."
4,52,movement,[33,11],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.41, such as [33,11] and [33,13]. Both are unoccupied and equally close. Choosing [33,11] arbitrarily as the target position to move to maximize welfare."
4,62,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is the maximum welfare available. The agent is currently at position [30,38] which also has sugar value 1.0. Since moving to any other position with the same sugar value does not provide additional welfare and the current position is unoccupied, the agent will not move."
4,85,movement,[29,11],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0. Among these, position [29,11] is unoccupied and closest. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake."
4,23,movement,[35,5],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, all positions with the highest sugar value (3.0) are equally good. The closest such positions are at distance 1.0: [35,5] and [34,6]. Moving to either will maximize welfare. Choosing [35,5] arbitrarily."
4,22,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent will stay in place."
4,91,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value and are unoccupied, including the current position. Therefore, there is no benefit in moving."
4,39,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
4,19,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
4,100,movement,[19,41],"The agent is currently at position [18,41] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions all have a sugar value of 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. The nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value is [19,41] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [19,41] to maximize welfare."
4,4,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
4,26,movement,[44,13],"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, any position is equally good, so the agent moves to [44, 13]."
4,53,movement,[37,7],"The agent is currently at position [36,8] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3, but all positions with sugar value 3 are occupied or at a distance greater than 1.41. The closest unoccupied positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 2 or more. The agent will move to the nearest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value, which is [37,7] at distance 1.41 and sugar value 3."
4,98,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Moving would not increase welfare, so the agent should stay in place."
4,15,movement,[31,15],"The agent is currently at position [31,16] with sugar value 1.0. There are multiple nearby positions within vision range that have a higher sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [31,15] and [32,16]. Both are equally good in terms of sugar value and distance. Choosing to move to [31,15] as it is directly north and equally beneficial."
5,74,movement,[37,1],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [37,1], [39,1], and [38,2] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Since all are equally good in terms of sugar and distance (distance 1), the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [37,1] arbitrarily as the target position."
5,57,movement,[14,43],"The agent has a vision of 6 and can see multiple positions with sugar values up to 4. The nearest positions with the maximum sugar value of 4 are at distances 1.0, 2.24, 4.47, and 6.0. Among these, the closest unoccupied position with sugar 4 is at [14, 43], which is at distance 1.0. Moving there maximizes welfare while minimizing movement distance."
5,43,movement,[41,7],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Since none of these positions are occupied, the agent should move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [41,7], [40,8], and [41,9]. The agent can choose any of these; choosing [41,7]."
5,50,movement,[15,37],"The agent is currently at position [14, 35] with 27 sugar. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at position [15, 37], which is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare as it provides the highest sugar value nearby. Other positions with sugar value 3.0 are closer but have less sugar. Therefore, the agent should move to [15, 37]."
5,39,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
5,42,movement,[24,10],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, any position with sugar value 2.0 and distance 1.0 is equally good. The agent moves to position [24,10]."
5,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
5,25,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value and are unoccupied, so moving does not increase welfare. Staying in the current position is optimal."
5,32,movement,[25,36],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is at distance 1.0. Among these, any position is equally good, so the agent moves to position [25,36]."
5,51,movement,[38,8],"The agent is currently at position [37,8] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions with higher sugar values (4.0) are at [33,10] and [32,9], but these are farther away (4.47 and 5.1 units respectively). Closer positions with sugar value 3.0 are available at [38,8], [38,7], and [38,9], all at distance 1.0 to 1.41 units. Since the agent can only move to unoccupied positions and these positions are unoccupied, the agent should move to one of these positions with sugar value 3.0 to maximize welfare while minimizing distance. Among these, [38,8] is the closest (distance 1.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [38,8]."
5,60,movement,[33,10],"The agent is currently at position [36,10] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are at [33,10] and [32,9], both with sugar value 4. Among these, [33,10] is closer (distance 3.0) compared to [32,9] (distance 4.12). Therefore, the agent should move to [33,10] to maximize welfare while minimizing distance."

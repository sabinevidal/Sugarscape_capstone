10,87,movement,[21,38],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [21,38], [20,39], and [22,39] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar value and distance, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [21,38] arbitrarily among them."
10,13,movement,[18,38],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision. Among these, the nearest unoccupied position is [18, 38] at a distance of 1.41. Moving there maximizes welfare while minimizing travel distance."
10,6,movement,null,"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the agent is already on a position with maximum welfare and no unoccupied position offers higher sugar, the agent will not move."
10,84,movement,[31,12],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except a few with lower values. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [31,12] and [32,13]. Both are unoccupied and equally close. Choosing [31,12] arbitrarily as it is adjacent and provides maximum welfare."
10,56,movement,[38,12],"The agent is currently at position [37,12] with sugar value 1. Nearby positions within vision have sugar values of 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0 or 1.41. The position [38,12] is unoccupied and has sugar value 3 at distance 1.0, which is the nearest maximum welfare position available. Therefore, the agent should move to [38,12]."
10,11,movement,[34,4],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [34,4] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare by collecting more sugar."
10,12,movement,[33,7],"The agent is currently at position [33,9] with sugar 1. The visible positions within vision range have a maximum sugar value of 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3 are at distances 2.0 to 2.24. The agent will choose the nearest position with maximum sugar value 3 that is unoccupied. The position [33,7] has sugar 3 and distance 2.0 and is unoccupied, so the agent will move there to maximize welfare."
10,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
11,58,movement,[31,6],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for some with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [31,6], [32,7], and [31,8]. Choosing any of these positions will maximize welfare. I select [31,6] as it is the closest and directly adjacent."
11,95,movement,[38,11],"The agent is currently at position [37,11] with sugar value 1. The nearest unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value (4) are [38,11], [36,13], [35,9], [36,8], [35,8], and [36,7]. Among these, [38,11] is the closest at distance 1.0 and unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [38,11] to maximize welfare."
11,24,movement,[14,40],"The agent is currently at position [15, 40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [14, 40], [16, 41], [13, 41], and [17, 41]. These positions are all at distances 1.0 to 1.41, which are the nearest positions with maximum welfare. Choosing the closest one, [14, 40], is optimal for maximizing sugar intake while minimizing movement distance."
11,11,movement,[35,4],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3.0. Positions [35,4], [33,3], and [33,5] each have sugar value 3.0 and are unoccupied. The closest among these is [35,4] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,4] to maximize welfare."
11,87,movement,[21,37],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [21,37], [20,38], and [22,38] each have the highest sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. Since all have equal sugar value and distance, moving to any of these positions maximizes welfare. Choosing [21,37] arbitrarily as the target position."
11,2,movement,[16,41],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at position [16, 41]. This position is unoccupied and within vision range, so the agent moves there to maximize welfare."
11,49,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have a sugar value of 0.0, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying in the current position is optimal."
11,55,movement,[33,3],"The agent is currently at position [32,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at positions [33,3], [33,5], [30,5], and [32,7]. The nearest of these is at distance 1.41 (positions [33,3] and [33,5]). Choosing [33,3] as it is the first encountered with max sugar and nearest distance. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake."
11,90,movement,[13,41],"The agent is currently at position [15, 39] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are at 4 sugar units, specifically at positions [13, 41], [17, 41], and [16, 43]. Among these, [13, 41] and [17, 41] are at a distance of 2.83, and [16, 43] is at 4.12. All these positions are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is either [13, 41] or [17, 41]. Choosing [13, 41] as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
11,85,movement,[35,8],"The agent is currently at position [32,8] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are those with sugar value 4 at positions [35,8], [35,9], [36,8], and [36,7]. Among these, [35,8] is the closest at distance 3.0 and is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [35,8] to maximize welfare."
11,71,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is the maximum welfare available. Since the agent is currently at position [28, 32] which also has sugar value 1.0 and is unoccupied, there is no benefit in moving to another position. Staying put conserves energy and avoids unnecessary movement."
11,70,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
11,80,movement,[35,9],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [35,9], [36,13], [36,8], and [36,7]. Among these, [35,9] is the closest at a distance of 2.24. Therefore, the agent will move to [35,9]."
11,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since moving does not provide any welfare benefit, the agent should stay in place."
11,53,movement,[36,7],"The agent is currently at position [33,6] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision allows it to see positions up to distance 6. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [36,7] and [36,8]. Both are at distances 3.16 and 3.61 respectively. The nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar) is [36,7]. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,7]."
11,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. There is no benefit in moving to any other position as they do not provide higher welfare."
11,13,movement,[17,41],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range. The maximum sugar value available in these positions is 4.0 at position [17, 41]. This position is unoccupied and within vision, so the agent moves there to maximize its welfare."

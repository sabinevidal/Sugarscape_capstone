15,80,movement,[35,8],"The agent is currently at position [32,8] with sugar 43. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are those with sugar 4.0 at distances 3.0 to 5.0, specifically positions [35,8], [35,9], [36,8], [36,10], and [37,8]. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 4.0 are [35,8] and [35,9] at distance 3.0 and 3.16 respectively. Both positions are unoccupied. Moving to [35,8] is chosen as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (highest sugar value) available to the agent."
15,84,movement,[31,10],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0, such as [31,10], [30,11], and [31,12]. These positions are unoccupied. Moving to any of these will increase welfare. Choosing [31,10] as it is the first found with max sugar at minimum distance."
15,2,movement,[14,40],"The agent is currently at position [15, 40] with sugar value 1. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0, available at multiple positions: [14, 40], [13, 40], [16, 38], [13, 39], [17, 41], [17, 38], [18, 40]. All these positions are unoccupied. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 4.0 is [14, 40] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 40] to maximize welfare."
15,46,movement,[16,38],"The agent is currently at position [15, 39]. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0. There are several positions with sugar value 4.0: [16, 38], [13, 39], [17, 38], [13, 40], and [17, 41]. The closest among these is [16, 38] at a distance of approximately 1.41. Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 38] to maximize welfare while minimizing distance."

Among these, [18, 40] and [17, 41] are at distance 1, which is closer than [17, 38] at distance 3.16. Both [18, 40] and [17, 41] are unoccupied. Choosing [18, 40] as it is directly adjacent and has maximum sugar value within vision range."
15,85,movement,[37,8],"The agent is currently at position [37,9] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are 4, but many of these positions are occupied. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar value 4 are [37,8], [36,8], and [36,10], all at distance 1 or 1.41. Among these, [37,8] is the closest at distance 1. Therefore, the agent should move to [37,8] to maximize welfare."
15,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have zero sugar value, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
15,95,movement,[38,11],"The agent is currently at position [39,9] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 4. The highest sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 4. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 4 are [38,11], [36,8], and [36,10]. The distances to these positions are approximately 2.24, 3.16, and 3.16 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 4 is [38,11]. Therefore, the agent should move to [38,11]."
15,87,movement,[19,35],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position at [19, 35] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare as per the movement rule."
15,29,movement,[36,10],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 4.0. Among these positions, the closest ones with sugar value 4.0 are at distances 1.41 and 2.24. The agent chooses to move to the closest position with maximum sugar value, which is at coordinates [36, 10]."
15,38,movement,[36,5],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: (36,5) and (38,5). Choosing (36,5) as it is one of the closest positions with maximum sugar value and unoccupied."
15,74,movement,[29,1],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, positions [29,1] and [28,2] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0 and are at distance 1.0. Choosing [29,1] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare."
15,27,movement,[28,2],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [28, 2] and [27, 3] both have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Both are at equal distance (1.0). Choosing to move to [28, 2] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum welfare."
15,11,movement,[35,3],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, those with the highest sugar value are 3.0 at positions [35,3], [33,5], [35,5], and [36,4]. All these positions are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.41. Choosing any of these maximizes welfare. I select position [35,3] as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value."

The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are [13, 39] and [13, 40], both with sugar value 4. These positions are at a distance of 2 and 2.24 respectively. Among these, [13, 39] is the closest position with maximum sugar value. Therefore, the agent should move to [13, 39] to maximize welfare."
15,15,movement,[35,9],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within vision range that are unoccupied. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [35,9] and [36,13]. Both are unoccupied. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar, which is [35,9] at a distance of 2.24, closer than [36,13] at 2.83. Therefore, the agent moves to [35,9]."
15,69,movement,[19,36],"The agent is currently at position [19, 37] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby positions within vision have sugar values mostly 3.0, which is higher than the current position. Among these, positions [19, 36] and [18, 37] are at distance 1.0 and have sugar value 3.0. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [19, 36] as it is directly adjacent and has maximum sugar value within vision. Moving there will maximize welfare."
15,81,movement,[31,5],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0 and 1.41. Among these, position [31,5] is unoccupied and at distance 1.0, so moving there maximizes welfare and is the nearest such position."
15,93,movement,[30,5],"The agent is currently at position [30,6] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range all have sugar values of 3 or less, with the maximum sugar value being 3. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1, specifically [30,5], [29,6], and [31,6]. However, [31,5] is occupied, so it is excluded. The agent chooses to move to one of the nearest unoccupied positions with maximum sugar value 3. Choosing [30,5] as it is unoccupied and at distance 1."
15,55,movement,[33,5],"The agent has a vision of 3 and can see multiple unoccupied positions with sugar values. The highest sugar value among visible unoccupied positions is 3.0 at positions [33,5] and [32,5], both at distances 2.0 and 2.24 respectively. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [33,5]."

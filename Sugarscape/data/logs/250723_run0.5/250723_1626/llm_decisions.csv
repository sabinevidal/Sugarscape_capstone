8,2,movement,[16,38],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [16,38] and [17,38]. Among these, [16,38] is closer (distance 4.12) compared to [17,38] (distance 5.1). Therefore, the agent moves to [16,38]."
8,5,movement,[17,38],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the maximum sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available in visible unoccupied positions is 4.0 at positions [17,38], [17,42], and [18,39]. Among these, [17,38] and [17,42] are at a distance of 2.83, and [18,39] is at 3.16. The agent chooses the nearest position with maximum sugar, which is [17,38]."
8,37,movement,[37,8],"The agent is currently at position [37,9] with sugar value 1. The agent's vision is 6, and it can see multiple positions with sugar value 4 at distances ranging from 1 to 5.1. Among these, the closest positions with maximum sugar value 4 are [37,8] at distance 1 and [35,10] at distance 2.24. Both positions are unoccupied. The agent will move to the nearest position with maximum sugar value, which is [37,8]."
8,49,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
8,79,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
8,53,movement,[34,7],"The agent is currently at position [37,4] with sugar 1. The visible positions within vision range have sugar values mostly 3 or 4, but many are occupied or farther away. The position [34,7] has the highest sugar value of 4 and is unoccupied. It is within the agent's vision range (distance 4.24). Moving there maximizes welfare by moving to the highest sugar value position available within vision and unoccupied."
8,39,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since moving does not increase welfare, the agent will stay in place."
8,96,movement,[12,39],"The agent is currently at position [12, 40] with sugar value 1. The visible positions within vision range all have sugar values of 3 or less, but the maximum sugar value available in unoccupied positions is 3. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1 (positions [12, 39] and [12, 41]). Since these positions are unoccupied and provide the maximum welfare (sugar value 3) within vision, the agent should move to one of these. Choosing [12, 39] as the target position as it is directly adjacent and unoccupied."
8,52,movement,[32,10],"The agent evaluates all visible positions within its vision range that are not occupied. The maximum sugar value available in visible positions is 4.0. Among these, the closest position with sugar value 4.0 is at coordinates [32,10] with a distance of 2.24. Therefore, the agent moves to [32,10] to maximize its welfare."
8,100,movement,[17,42],"The agent is currently at position [17, 41] with sugar value 1. The visible positions with the highest sugar value are [17, 42] and [18, 39], both with sugar value 4. Among these, [17, 42] is closer (distance 1.0) and unoccupied, while [18, 39] is at distance 2.24 and also unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [17, 42] to maximize welfare by moving to the nearest position with the highest sugar value available."
8,6,movement,null,"All visible positions have the same sugar value of 1.0, which is the maximum welfare available within vision range. Since the current position [24,29] also has a sugar value of 1.0 and is unoccupied, the agent will not move to avoid unnecessary movement."
8,13,movement,[18,39],"The agent is currently at position [14, 40] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions with the highest sugar value are at [18, 39] with sugar 4. This position is within the agent's vision range (distance 4.12) and unoccupied. Moving there maximizes the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake."
8,23,movement,[36,3],"Among the visible unoccupied positions, the position [36, 3] has the highest sugar value of 3.0 and is within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to other positions with sugar values of 2.0 or less."
8,94,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0, including the current position. Since there is no better position to move to, the agent will stay in place."
8,15,movement,[33,12],"The agent evaluates all visible unoccupied positions within its vision range and finds that the maximum sugar value available is 4.0. Among these positions with sugar value 4.0, the closest one is at position [33,12] with a distance of 1.41. Therefore, the agent moves to [33,12] to maximize its welfare."
8,14,movement,[13,35],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value (3.0) are at distance 1.0: [13,35], [12,36], and [14,36]. Since [14,36] is occupied by the agent itself, it is not considered. Among the remaining, any can be chosen. Choosing [13,35] as it is directly north and at distance 1.0."
8,65,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have the same sugar value of 1.0. Since the current position is unoccupied and has maximum welfare equal to the neighbors, the agent will not move."
8,90,movement,[13,38],"The agent is currently at position [14, 39] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, the maximum sugar value available is 3.0. All positions with sugar value 3.0 are unoccupied and at various distances. The nearest positions with sugar value 3.0 are at distances approximately 1.41 to 3.61. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is at [13, 38] (distance 1.41). Therefore, the agent should move to [13, 38] to maximize welfare."
8,7,movement,[11,34],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the position [11, 34] has the highest sugar value of 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare as per the movement rule."
8,97,movement,null,"All visible positions including the current one have a sugar value of 0.0, so there is no benefit in moving. Staying in place conserves energy and avoids unnecessary movement."
8,68,movement,null,"The agent has a vision of 3 and can only move to positions within that range. All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 0 and are unoccupied. Since there is no position within vision that produces more sugar than the current position, the agent will not move."
8,42,movement,[24,7],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.0. Among these, any position is equally good. Choosing position [24,7] as it is directly north and at distance 1.0."
8,73,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have the same sugar value of 1.0, including the current position. Since the agent is already on a position with maximum welfare (sugar value 1.0) and all other positions have equal sugar value, there is no benefit in moving."
8,20,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
8,84,movement,[33,11],"The agent looks for the nearest unoccupied position with the highest sugar value within its vision range. The highest sugar value available is 4.0 at positions [33,11] and [35,12]. Both are unoccupied. The distances are 3.16 and 5.0 respectively. The nearest position with maximum sugar is [33,11]."

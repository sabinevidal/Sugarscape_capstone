19,38,movement,[35,5],"The agent has a vision of 2 and can see several unoccupied positions with sugar values of 3.0 at distances 1.0 and 1.41. Since all these positions have the same maximum sugar value of 3.0, the agent will move to the nearest one to maximize welfare. The nearest unoccupied positions with sugar 3.0 are at [35,5] and [36,6], both at distance 1.0. The agent chooses to move to [35,5] as it is the first encountered position with maximum sugar value within vision range."
19,103,movement,[36,10],"The agent is currently at position [36,11] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions within vision have sugar values mostly 3 or 4. The position [36,10] has the highest sugar value of 4 and is unoccupied. It is also the nearest position with maximum welfare. Therefore, the agent should move to [36,10]."
19,95,movement,[40,9],"The agent is currently at position [40,10] with sugar value 1.0. All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except for the current position and a few with 2.0 or 1.0. Among the visible positions with sugar value 3.0, the nearest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0: [40,9], [41,10]. Both have the same sugar value and are unoccupied. The agent chooses to move to [40,9] as it is the closest position with maximum welfare (sugar value 3.0)."
19,80,movement,[33,11],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.41: [33,11] and [35,13]. Choosing the closest one with the minimum distance, the agent will move to [33,11]."
19,13,movement,[16,37],"The agent is currently at position [17, 38] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at positions [16, 37] and [14, 40]. Both are unoccupied and within vision range. The nearest position with maximum sugar value is [16, 37] at distance 1.41, which is closer than [14, 40] at distance 3.61. Therefore, the agent should move to [16, 37] to maximize welfare."
19,66,movement,[38,6],"All visible unoccupied positions have the same sugar value of 3.0. The nearest positions with this maximum sugar value are at distance 1.0: [38,6], [40,6], and [39,7]. Choosing [38,6] as it is the first in the list and equally optimal."
19,59,movement,[14,40],"The agent is currently at position [18, 41] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible positions, the highest sugar value is 4.0 at position [14, 40], which is unoccupied and within vision range. Moving there maximizes welfare as it provides the highest sugar value nearby. The distance to [14, 40] is approximately 4.12, which is within the agent's vision of 5. Therefore, the agent should move to [14, 40]."
19,59,reproduction,[57],"Agent 59 is male and has two eligible female partners within vision. Partner 31 has no empty nearby positions for offspring placement, so reproduction is not possible with her. Partner 57 has an empty nearby position at [14,42], allowing for offspring placement. Agent 59 has sufficient sugar (38) above the minimum required (12) for reproduction. Therefore, reproduction will occur with partner 57 only, as she is the only partner meeting all criteria including having an empty adjacent site for the child."
19,53,movement,[37,7],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position's sugar value of 1.0. Among these, the closest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [37,7] and [39,7]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [37,7] as it is the first found with maximum welfare and minimum distance."
19,53,reproduction,[12,56],"Agent 53 is female, has sufficient sugar (47) above the minimum required (20) for reproduction, and has two eligible male partners (IDs 12 and 56) within vision range who are fertile and have empty neighboring sites. Both partners have empty nearby positions for offspring placement, and the agent also has empty neighboring sites. Since the agent can reproduce with up to 2 partners, both partners are selected to maximize reproductive opportunities and genetic diversity."
19,17,movement,[10,30],"Among the unoccupied visible positions within vision range, the positions [10, 30], [12, 30], and [11, 31] each have the highest sugar value of 2.0. All are at distance 1.0, so the agent can move to any of these to maximize welfare. Choosing [10, 30] arbitrarily as the target position."
19,88,movement,[12,41],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [12,41] and [13,42]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [12,41] as it is the first found with max sugar and nearest."
19,7,movement,[17,33],"Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, positions [17,33] and [16,34] both have the highest sugar value of 3.0. Both are at the same distance (1.0). Choosing to move to [17,33] as it is one of the positions with maximum welfare."
19,52,movement,[35,13],"The agent is currently at position [36, 12] with sugar value 1.0. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values are at [35, 13] and [36, 14] both with sugar value 3.0 and distance within vision range. These positions are unoccupied and provide maximum welfare compared to other visible positions. Among these, [35, 13] is closer (distance 1.41) than [36, 14] (distance 2.0). Therefore, the agent should move to [35, 13] to maximize welfare."
19,52,reproduction,[15],"Agent 52 is male, age 20, with sugar 42 which is above the minimum required for reproduction (8). There is one eligible partner, agent 15, who is female, age 19, with sugar 23. Agent 15 has empty nearby positions and agent 52 also has empty nearby positions, fulfilling the requirement that at least one of the pair has an empty adjacent site. Since the max partners is 3 and only one eligible partner is available, agent 52 will reproduce with agent 15."
19,106,movement,[15,42],"The agent is currently at position [15, 41] with sugar value 2.0. Among the visible positions within vision range, all unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is higher than the current position. The nearest such positions are at distance 1.0 (position [15, 42]). Moving to [15, 42] will maximize the agent's welfare by increasing sugar intake while being the closest available position with maximum sugar value."
19,60,movement,[32,8],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. Among these, the nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [32,8] and [32,10]. Both are unoccupied and equally good in terms of sugar and distance. Choosing to move to [32,8] as it is directly above current position and unoccupied."
19,55,movement,[31,4],"The agent is currently at position [32,4] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0, available at multiple positions within vision range 3. The nearest positions with sugar 3.0 are at distance 1.0: [31,4], [33,4], and [32,5]. Since all have equal sugar and distance, the agent can move to any of these. Choosing [31,4] arbitrarily as the target position to maximize welfare."
19,109,movement,[38,13],"All visible positions within vision have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum available in the visible area. Among these, the closest unoccupied positions are at distance 1.0, such as (38,13), (37,14), and (38,14). Choosing (38,13) as it is unoccupied and nearest with maximum sugar value."
19,105,movement,[14,38],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except the current position which has 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar value 3.0 are at distance 1.0 to 3.61. Among these, the closest unoccupied position is [14,38] at distance 1.0 with sugar 3.0. Moving there maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake and is the nearest such position."
19,31,movement,[16,39],"The agent is currently at position [15, 40] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions, the maximum sugar value is 3.0. There are multiple positions with sugar value 3.0, but the nearest one is at [16, 39] with a distance of 1.41. Moving there maximizes welfare while minimizing distance."
19,21,movement,null,"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 0.0, including the current position. Since there is no position with higher sugar value to move to, the agent will stay in place."
19,50,movement,[13,43],"All visible positions have a sugar value of 3.0, which is the maximum welfare available in the visible area. Among these, the nearest positions are at distance 1.0: [13,43] and [14,44]. Both are unoccupied. Choosing [13,43] as it is the first found with maximum sugar and minimum distance."
19,29,movement,[39,12],"The agent is currently at position [38,12] with sugar value 1. The visible unoccupied positions all have a sugar value of 3, which is higher than the current position. Among these, the closest positions with sugar value 3 are at distance 1.0 or approximately 1.41. The closest unoccupied position with maximum sugar value is [39,12] at distance 1.0. Therefore, the agent should move to [39,12] to maximize welfare."
19,107,movement,[31,2],"The agent has a vision of 1 and can see positions [30,2], [31,2], [30,3], and [29,2]. Among these, the maximum sugar value is 2.0. The current position [30,2] has sugar 2.0 but is occupied by the agent itself, so it is not considered a move. The positions [31,2] and [30,3] both have sugar 2.0 and are unoccupied. Both are at distance 1, so the agent can move to either. Choosing [31,2] as the target position for movement."
19,42,movement,[28,2],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the positions [28,2], [27,3], [26,3], [28,3], and [27,4] all have the highest sugar value of 2.0. Among these, [28,2] and [27,3] are the closest at distance 1.0. However, [28,1] is occupied, so [28,2] is unoccupied and closest with maximum sugar. Therefore, the agent should move to [28,2]."

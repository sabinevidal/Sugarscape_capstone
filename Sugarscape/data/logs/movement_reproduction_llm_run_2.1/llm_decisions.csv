Since the agent wants to maximize welfare and both unoccupied positions have the same sugar value, it can move to either. Choosing (32,2) as it is one of the nearest positions with maximum sugar value within vision."
27,15,movement,[31,7],"The agent is currently at position [32,5] with sugar value 1. Nearby visible positions with higher sugar values are at [31,7], [30,7], [29,6], and [31,8], each with sugar value 3.0. Among these, [31,7] is the closest at a distance of 2.24. This position is unoccupied and within the agent's vision range. Therefore, moving to [31,7] maximizes welfare by increasing sugar intake while being the nearest such position."
27,124,movement,[14,37],"Among the visible positions within vision range, the position [14, 37] has the highest sugar value of 2.0 and is unoccupied. Moving there maximizes welfare compared to staying at the current position or moving to other adjacent positions with lower sugar values or that are occupied."
27,24,movement,[17,43],"All visible unoccupied positions have a sugar value of 3.0 except a few with 2.0 or 1.0. The nearest positions with maximum sugar (3.0) are at distance 1.0, such as (17,43), (18,44), and (17,45). Choosing (17,43) as it is the closest and directly adjacent, maximizing welfare while minimizing movement cost."
27,120,movement,[34,3],"All visible positions within vision range have a sugar value of 2.0 and are unoccupied except the current position and positions occupied by neighbors. Among these, the nearest positions with maximum sugar value 2.0 are at distance 1.41. Choosing one of these positions to move to will maximize welfare."
27,106,movement,[31,8],"The agent is currently at position [33,7] with sugar value 1.0. Among the visible unoccupied positions within vision range, the highest sugar value is 3.0 at multiple positions such as [31,8], [31,9], [30,7], [30,8], [30,9], [29,7], [29,6], [30,10], and [31,11]. The nearest position with maximum sugar value 3.0 is [31,8] at distance 2.24, which is unoccupied. Therefore, the agent should move to [31,8] to maximize welfare."

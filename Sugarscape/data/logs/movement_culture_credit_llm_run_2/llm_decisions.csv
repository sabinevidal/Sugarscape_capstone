According to the culture rule, we randomly select one tag position per neighbour to compare. Since the selected tag differs, the agent decides to spread its culture by flipping the neighbour's tag at index 3 to match its own. This is the only neighbour and tag position considered, so only one decision is made."

The highest sugar value available within vision is 4 at positions [18, 41] and [17, 42], both at distance 2.24. Moving to [18, 41] is chosen as it is the nearest position with maximum welfare (sugar value 4)."

The closest such positions are at distance 2.0, for example [32, 12] or [34, 14]. Moving to one of these positions will maximize the agent's welfare."

Randomly selecting tag index 3 for comparison reveals a difference, so the agent should spread culture to flip the neighbor's tag at this position. No other neighbors to consider, so only one decision is made."
